The prepping_data file is mostly scraping and embedding the data, cli.py is what you're probably more interested in. It needs a Mistral and a Groq API key but you can change the base_url and use whatever models you want. 

`pip install torch sentence_transformers openai bs4 requests flask`

The API is pretty neet. I didn't update it but pretty sure it still works. Hope this helps!
