            "IntroductionFinancial assets are not the only items of value held on trust by personal insolvency practitioners. In the course of their work, practitioners will obtain and retain sensitive data and information, including from debtors and creditors, as well as about their financial affairs.The purpose of this guideline is to outline the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy\u2019s expectations about data and information management, and to provide practitioners with a set of principles to use in their decision making about the security and storage of information and administration records.This guideline is relevant for trustees, controlling trustees and debt agreement administrators. The requirements and expectations about the period of retention of administration records can be found inTrustees\u2019 guidelines relating to handling funds(IGPD5) andDebt agreement administrator guide to proper accounts (IGPD15).[1]\n\nFinancial assets are not the only items of value held on trust by personal insolvency practitioners.

It is important that practitioners clearly understand and manage these risks, and comply with their obligations, including those under thePrivacy Act 1988and theAustralian Privacy Principles.The security threat posed to Australian businesses of all sizes is very real. Malicious attempts to gain access to data and information are increasing in frequency, and it is vital that practitioners are taking appropriate steps to protect the information they hold \u2013 regardless of the systems they choose to use.The Inspector- General strongly encourages awareness of and adherence to the principles of Cyber Resilience, as promoted by theAustralian Cyber Security Centre(ACSC). This concerns the ability to adapt to disruptions caused by cyber security incidents while maintaining continuous business operations. This includes the ability to detect, manage and recover from cyber security incidents.

It is expected practitioners will have robust systems in place that can clearly demonstrate the following:Information is accessed on a strictly \u2018need to know\u2019 basisFor example, access is limited to specialist insolvency staff only, with an available audit trail, and there is regular staff training about handling private information and the importance of good record keeping.There is a clear understanding of where data is heldFor example, the practitioner can clearly identify the systems and locations where data and information are held. For digital and cloud-based systems, there is a clear understanding of where data resides, and these arrangements comply with relevant domestic and foreign jurisdictional requirements.Only secure and up-to-date systems are usedFor example, the practitioner can demonstrate that appropriate protections are in place, any software used is the current version, and that appropriate structures are in place to review and update controls.An awareness of the Notifiable Data Breach SchemePlease note, this only applies to firms subject to the Privacy Act 1988.A documented security risk assessment is in place and refreshed regularlyThe responses to these statements will change from practitioner to practitioner, depending on the systems used.\n\nThe Bankruptcy Act 1966 does not specify how practitioners must maintain records.

co-owner and the trustee own the property as tenants in common.Effect of bankruptcy on tenancies in commonWhere the bankrupt and a co-owner owned the property as tenants in common, their proportionate interest remain unchanged, with the bankrupt\u2019s proportionate interest vesting in the trustee.Rights of mortgageesA party holding a valid registered mortgage maintains its right to deal with (including to sell) the property to pay the mortgage if the mortgagors do not maintain payments.\u00a0 Where the mortgagee sells the property, the trustee is entitled to claim a proportion of any surplus sale proceeds, following discharge of the mortgage.Options for dealing with real estateOptions available to the trustee for sale of the property may include:awaiting sale of the property by the mortgagee and claiming the trustee\u2019s interest in the sale proceeds at settlementwhere there is a co-owner, selling the trustee\u2019s interest to the co-ownerdisclaiming the property, if it is burdened by onerous covenants (see section 133 of the Bankruptcy Act)selling the property on the open market, including by auctionif there is a co-owner that does not agree to sell the property on the open market, the trustee can consider making an application to the Court to have trustees appointed for the partition and mandatory sale of the property, under the supervision of the Court. \u00a0If this course is pursued, the co-owner may bear the legal costs of any such application.Property in which the bankrupt has an equitable interest, even if not recorded on titleIn certain situations, a bankrupt may have an equitable interest, even if this is not recorded on title.\u00a0 For example, the equitable concept of a resulting trust means that, where two parties contribute to the purchase of a property that is registered in the name of one of them, the registered proprietor is presumed to hold an interest on trust for the other party.\u00a0 It is also the case that the High Court accepted inTrustees of the Property of John Daniel Cummins v Cummins[2006] HCA 6the principle that \u201cwhere a husband and wife purchase a matrimonial home, each contributing to the purchase price, and title is taken in the name of one of them, it may be inferred that it was intended that each of the spouses should have a one-half interest in the property, regardless of the amounts contributed by them\u201d (i.e. where a husband is the only party registered on title, but both the husband and wife contributed to the purchase price, the wife has a half interest in the property).The effect of such equitable interests is that the trustee may have an interest in property and may have the right to take action to realise it for the benefit of the estate, even if the bankrupt is not recorded on title.\n\n",

framework \u2013 debt agreement administratorsAll administrators and their representatives must comply with industry-wide conditions imposed by the Minister pursuant to subsection 186F(4) of theBankruptcy Act 1966. \u00a0One of these conditions[1]requires that the advertising and promotion of services by administrators and those advertising or promoting their services on their behalf must:include the full name and registration number of the administratornot be false, misleading or deceptive.Failure by administrators and their representatives to adhere to this registration condition may lead to disciplinary action, including cancellation of an individual\u2019s or company\u2019s registration.There are also legislative requirements applicable to advertising and promotions generally in the Australian Consumer Law (\u201cACL\u201d). \u00a0The ACL is administered and enforced by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (\u201cACCC\u201d), in conjunction with State and Territory consumer protection bodies, with the involvement of the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (\u201cASIC\u201d) on relevant matters. \u00a0The protections in the ACL are generally reflected in similar provisions in theAustralian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001so that financial products and services are treated in the same way.Legal framework \u2013 trusteesFor registered trustees and their representatives, there are legislative requirements applicable to advertising and promotion in the ACL. \u00a0They are also required under the Act andInsolvency Practice Rules (Bankruptcy) 2016to maintain professionalism, independence, impartiality, honesty and ethics.Failure by a registered trustee and their representatives to adhere to this document may call into question the trustee\u2019s standing as a fit and proper person. \u00a0For further information about what it means to be fit and proper person in order to maintain registration as a practitioner, seeFit and proper requirements for personal insolvency practitioners.Guidance can also be found at rules 250.2 of theAPES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, which states:A Member in Public Practice shall not bring the profession into disrepute when marketing Professional Services. \u00a0The Member in Public Practice shall be honest and truthful and not:(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Make exaggerated claims for services offered, qualifications possessed, or experience gained; or(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Make disparaging references or unsubstantiated comparisons to the work of another.If the Member in Public Practice is in doubt about whether a proposed form of Advertising or marketing is appropriate, the Member in Public Practice shall consider consulting with the relevant professional body.Professional codes and bodiesPersonal insolvency

The matter may also be referred to ASIC, ACCC and/or PIPA/ARITA for investigation.The Inspector-General\u2019s requirements are as follows.There is a need for debtors to have direct and reliable access to AFSA\u2019s independent website. \u00a0In the past, some administrators used the phrase or acronym \u201cAFSA\u201d as Google-sponsored advertising. \u00a0This created the potential for users attempting to access the AFSA website to be misled into accessing the administrator\u2019s website. \u00a0Should it come to\u00a0AFSA\u2019s attention that this practice is reoccurring, immediate action will be taken to ensure the administrator remedies their conduct..There is a need for the duties of an administrator and the available options in the Bankruptcy Act for debtors in financial distress to be clearly and accurately stated in language that is easily understood by the target audience.It is necessary to ensure ongoing confidence in the personal insolvency system and, in particular, the accurate representation of AFSA\u2019s involvement in the debt agreement process.Administrators are to ensure that they are aware of and comply with the relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation when developing and implementing their advertising and promotion.It is important to acknowledge that advertisements may be misleading or deceptive even when there is no such intention. \u00a0Administrators, trustees, brokers and other promotors should therefore consider how their advertising and promotion may be interpreted or how it may affect the person receiving the message. \u00a0This involves understanding the target audience and appreciating their backgrounds, vulnerabilities, circumstances and understanding of the financial environment.Representing debt agreements as debt consolidationWhat is \u201cdebt consolidation\u201d?ASIC issued a report in July 2013[2]which reviewed responsible lending conduct by credit assistance providers. \u00a0The report defined \u201cdebt consolidation\u201d as:\u2026 a financial service whereby new credit is secured to pay off other existing credit contracts or reduce total payments. \u00a0Debt consolidation may affect several types of credit contracts including home loans, credit cards, personal loans and payday loans, and frequently involves a lower interest rate over a longer term. \u00a0Debt consolidation may be facilitated by taking security over what were previously unsecured debts. \u00a0It is promoted as helping consumers manage their repayment obligations under multiple credit providers or multiple credit contracts.Debt consolidation falls under the definition of \u201ccredit assistance\u201d under section 8 of theNational Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009.Debt consolidation is not to be confused with debt agreements, which do not refinance existing loans or consolidate the underlying indebtedness into one new obligation.\u00a0 While most administrators do not provide credit assistance, many have included the term \u201cdebt consolidation\u201d when advertising or promoting debt agreement services to consumers.The ASIC report, which only included entities which offer credit assistance (i.e. those that arrange new or extra credit for consumers to deal with pre-existing credit obligations) provided examples of advertising language used by credit assistance providers:\u201cDebt problems can be solved by simply consolidating existing debts\u201d\u201cHelp you consolidate and save\u201d\u201cDebt consolidation is one of the best \u2018debt help\u2019

Edwards[2011] NSWLC, the NSW Local court found that an unregistered debt agreement administrator who advertised debt agreement services as \u201cdebt consolidation\u201d had engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct.The administrator in that case advertised \u201cno interest debt consolidation\u201d to promote debt agreements to consumers seeking relief from overwhelming debts.\u00a0 The court considered the principles relating to \u201cmisleading and deceptive conduct\u201d under section 42 of theFair Trading Act 1987(NSW) summarised by Goldberg J inTelstra Corp Ltd v Cable & Wireless Optus Ltd[2001] FCA 1478at [21]-[25].These principles require the Court to review a published advertisement through the eyes of a reasonable consumer and to consider that:it is designed and calculated to be seen and read by a wide range of peoplethe question of whether or not an advertisement is misleading or deceptive is tested by the effect it has on the those most likely to consider it.no person must be assumed to be able to supply any omitted facts or resolve ambiguitiesan advertisement may be misleading even though it fails to deceive more wary readers.The Court accepted that \u201cthe ordinary understanding of the term \u2018debt consolidation\u2019 involves refinancing of one or more high interest debts into a single loan that has the advantage of lower interest rates and often over a longer term to produce a single affordable and regular repayment plan\u201d.The Court also referred to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th ed 2009) which defines \u201cdebt consolidation\u201d as \u201cThe replacement of multiple loans from one or more lenders with a single loan from one lender, usually with a lower monthly payment and a longer repayment period\u201d.The Court noted that the term is not ordinarily used in the context of debt agreements as \u201cthe debtor remains liable to all existing creditors and there is no consolidation of debt\u201d.The concern raised by the Court was that potential customers reading the term could misapprehend the nature of the services offered by the administrator by wrongly assuming the service\u00a0\u201cprovides the option of financial support through consolidating of multiple debts through a single loan\u201d.Given the findings in this case, the Inspector-General expects that administrators, brokers and others will not include any reference to the term \u201cdebt consolidation\u201d in promoting debt agreements.\n\n",

            "False representation and misleading and deceptive conductGeneral principlesAdvertising and promotional activities can amount to conduct which is false, misleading or

below for specific examples of false, misleading or deceptive conduct. \u00a0These guides should be read carefully by administrators, trustees, pre-insolvency advisors, brokers and other promoters of debt agreements and other insolvency options to ensure that they understand their legal obligations under consumer law.Common ways in which advertising and promotion of personal insolvency services may mislead or deceive include (but are not limited to):misleading information describing the essence of personal insolvencyconveying that a debt agreement or personal insolvency agreement is less serious and has less significant consequences than a bankruptcyimplying that the administrator is able to readily facilitate a debt agreement being made that will not be overly onerous on the debtor to satisfyrepresenting that the entire debt agreement process is regulated or approved by AFSA (or some other authority/instrument of the Commonwealth government)concealing or understating negative consequences of a personal insolvency option by, for example, adversely comparing a debt agreement with bankruptcy or vice versa.ExamplesThe following table represents some examples of unacceptable forms of advertising due to their potential to mislead and/or deceive consumers.Unacceptable advertisingWhy it is unacceptable\u201cSTOP DEBT NOW.Commonwealth Government-guaranteed and regulated debt agreement will free you of debt forever\u201dThe advertisement makes two incorrect claims:that the debt agreement is guaranteed by the Commonwealth Governmenta person who enters into a debt agreement will be released from all of their debts.\u00a0 A debt agreement will only release a debtor from unsecured provable debts incurred up to the time the debt agreement proposal is accepted for processing, and then only if the terms of the agreement are complied with and completed.\u00a0 There are also types of debts that the debtor will not be released from upon successful completion of a debt agreement, such as penalties and fines, child support and fraud-related debt.Australian Government logoIt is improper for a practitioner to use the Commonwealth Coat of Arms in any material.Unauthorised useof the Commonwealth Coat of Arms may breach the CCA,Trade Marks Act 1995(Cth) or theCriminal Code Act 1995(Cth).\u201cConsolidate your debts into one easy repayment through a government regulated debt agreement.\u201dUse of the terms \u201cGovernment legislated\u201d and \u201cGovernment approved\u201dA debt agreement is not a consolidation of debt. \u00a0It is inappropriate to refer to a debt agreement as debt consolidation.Referring to a debt agreement as \u201cgovernment regulated\u201d implies that each and every debt agreement is regulated. \u00a0This is not the case. \u00a0It is the industry or Part IX regime that is regulated.The phrase \u201cgovernment regulated debt agreement\u201d should not be used, nor should the terms \u201cgovernment legislated\u201d or \u201cgovernment approved\u201d.\u201cIf you complete the debt agreement you will get full release from only those creditors listed in the debt agreement\u201dThis is factually incorrect and misrepresents the intention of the Bankruptcy Act.\u201cAll stages of the debt agreement are legislated, monitored and facilitated by AFSA\u201dThis misrepresents AFSA\u2019s involvement in the process and uses AFSA\u2019s name in a misleading manner.\u201cDebt agreements show up more favourably on your credit record than a bankruptcy\u201dThis is actually factually incorrect as there is no difference in the reporting of debt agreements and bankruptcies on a credit report. \u00a0Also, the lending policies of banks and other credit providers are matters for the individual institutions.\u201cYou can choose which debts to include and which ones to exclude, e.g. you will want to maintain electricity in your home so it may be best to exclude essential services\u201dThis is factually incorrect and misrepresents the intention of the Bankruptcy Act.\u201cAFSA compliant \u2013 Our system complies with legislation as required by AFSA\u201dThis misrepresents to potential debtors that AFSA has reviewed, approved and/or certified the administrator\u2019s system as \u201ccompliant\u201d, when AFSA does not do this.\u201cFreeze your interest\u201dIf a debt agreement is terminated at any time, the interest on the debts will start accruing again, whereas this statement may give the incorrect impression that it is frozen forever.Testimonials or promoting debt write offs of up to 80%This is incorrect as it is up to a creditor to write off a debt. \u00a0Testimonials and claims of high percentage savings that are false and unable to be substantiated are misleading.\u201cA debt agreement will let you write off debt\u201dThis is incorrect as it is up to a creditor to write off a debt.\u201cYou can keep your home\u201dThis may give a potential bankrupt a false sense of security that their home will never be sold once they become bankrupt. The property will vest with the trustee and may be realised if there is sufficient equity.ConfidentialA debtor or bankrupt\u2019s name will appear on the publicly available National Personal Insolvency Index (NPII).Guaranteed acceptanceThere is no guarantee as debt agreements are subject to creditor approval and bankruptcies are subject to Official Receiver acceptance.Case studyThe below case study reflect the issues arising from advertising and promotion of debt agreements.John and Jane contact a broker after seeing a TV advert as they want to \u201cclean\u201d their credit reports. \u00a0The broker provides a number of other debt services, including debt agreements, debt negotiation and debt consolidation. \u00a0John and Jane are told that the broker offers a \u201ccredit restoration process\u201d and a \u201cdebt solution process\u201d.While John and Jane are interested in the service to \u201cclean\u201d their credit reports, they are eventually persuaded to enter into two debt agreements. \u00a0John and Jane are renters with no property and struggle to make payments and provide necessities for their children while also making payments under the debt agreements.John and Jane felt confused by the broker\u2019s services and what the best option was for them.While this case study does not represent the experience of all debtors with administrators and brokers, it indicates some typical concerns raised by stakeholders.\n\n",

they understand their legal obligations under consumer law.\n\nCommon ways in which advertising and promotion of personal insolvency services may mislead or deceive include (but are not limited to):misleading information describing the essence of personal insolvencyconveying that a debt agreement or personal insolvency agreement is less serious and has less significant consequences than a bankruptcyimplying that the administrator is able to readily facilitate a debt agreement being made that will not be overly onerous on the debtor to satisfyrepresenting that the entire debt agreement process is regulated or approved by AFSA (or some other authority/instrument of the Commonwealth government)concealing or understating negative consequences of a personal insolvency option by, for example, adversely comparing a debt agreement with bankruptcy or vice versa.\n\nmisleading information describing the essence of personal insolvency\n\nconveying that a debt agreement or personal

DEBT NOW.Commonwealth Government-guaranteed and regulated debt agreement will free you of debt forever\u201dThe advertisement makes two incorrect claims:that the debt agreement is guaranteed by the Commonwealth Governmenta person who enters into a debt agreement will be released from all of their debts.\u00a0 A debt agreement will only release a debtor from unsecured provable debts incurred up to the time the debt agreement proposal is accepted for processing, and then only if the terms of the agreement are complied with and completed.\u00a0 There are also types of debts that the debtor will not be released from upon successful completion of a debt agreement, such as penalties and fines, child support and fraud-related debt.Australian Government logoIt is improper for a practitioner to use the Commonwealth Coat of Arms in any material.Unauthorised useof the Commonwealth Coat of Arms may breach the CCA,Trade Marks Act 1995(Cth) or theCriminal Code Act 1995(Cth).\u201cConsolidate your debts into one easy repayment through a government regulated debt agreement.\u201dUse of the terms \u201cGovernment legislated\u201d and \u201cGovernment approved\u201dA debt agreement is not a consolidation of debt. \u00a0It is inappropriate to refer to a debt agreement as debt consolidation.Referring to a debt agreement as \u201cgovernment regulated\u201d implies that each and every debt agreement is regulated. \u00a0This is not the case. \u00a0It is the industry or Part IX regime that is regulated.The phrase \u201cgovernment regulated debt agreement\u201d should not be used, nor should the terms \u201cgovernment legislated\u201d or \u201cgovernment approved\u201d.\u201cIf you complete the debt agreement you will get full release from only those creditors listed in the debt agreement\u201dThis is factually incorrect and misrepresents the intention of the Bankruptcy Act.\u201cAll stages of the debt agreement are legislated, monitored and facilitated by AFSA\u201dThis misrepresents AFSA\u2019s involvement in the process and uses AFSA\u2019s name in a misleading manner.\u201cDebt agreements show up more favourably on your credit record than a bankruptcy\u201dThis is actually factually incorrect as there is no difference in the reporting of debt agreements and bankruptcies on a credit report. \u00a0Also, the lending policies of banks and other credit providers are matters for the individual institutions.\u201cYou can choose which debts to include and which ones to exclude, e.g. you will want to maintain electricity in your home so it may be best to exclude essential services\u201dThis is factually incorrect and misrepresents the intention of the Bankruptcy Act.\u201cAFSA compliant \u2013 Our system complies with legislation as required by AFSA\u201dThis misrepresents to potential debtors that AFSA has reviewed, approved and/or certified the administrator\u2019s system as \u201ccompliant\u201d, when AFSA does not do this.\u201cFreeze your interest\u201dIf a debt agreement is terminated at any time, the interest on the debts will start accruing again, whereas this statement may give the incorrect impression that it is frozen forever.Testimonials or promoting debt write offs of up to 80%This is incorrect as it is up to a creditor to write off a debt. \u00a0Testimonials and claims of high percentage savings that are false and unable to be substantiated are misleading.\u201cA debt agreement will let you write off debt\u201dThis is incorrect as it is up to a creditor to write off a debt.\u201cYou can keep your home\u201dThis may give a potential bankrupt a false sense of security that their home will never be sold once they become bankrupt. The property will vest with the trustee and may be realised if there is sufficient equity.ConfidentialA debtor or bankrupt\u2019s name will appear on the publicly available National Personal Insolvency Index (NPII).Guaranteed acceptanceThere is no guarantee as debt agreements are subject to creditor approval and bankruptcies are subject to Official Receiver acceptance.\n\n",

If the former bankrupt had not contacted the trustee and could not be located, the trustee could pay the money to the CRF.\u00a0 If the former bankrupt does later contact the trustee to enquire about the surplus money, the practitioner is expected to refer the former bankrupt to AFSA to enquire about making a claim to the money.Where money is held and a decision is made not to pay it to anyone (subsection 254(2)(b))Where a practitioner holds money and proposes not to pay it to any person, this is required to be paid to the CRF.It is the Inspector-General\u2019s position that paragraph 254(2)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act is confined to the following situations:it is not proposed to distribute or pay the money to any person because there is no person entitled to the money, for example the person entitled has died leaving no will, no dependants and no relativeswhere a relatively small amount is held by the practitioner and the cost of distributing this money to creditors would outweigh the benefit.Note that, if the money would otherwise be payable to a deregistered company, the entitlement to the money vests in the Australian Securities & Investments Commission, and so point 1 in the previous paragraph is not appliable.\u00a0 More information is available onASIC\u2019s website.Example 3Following payment of a final dividend to creditors, the practitioner has $35 remaining in a bankrupt estate.\u00a0 The estate is to be finalised as there are no further realisations expected.\u00a0 Although creditors didn\u2019t receive a 100c in the dollar dividend and so they have not been paid in full, the time taken to distribute the $35 to creditors will be approximately one hour and the work would incur more remuneration by the trustee\u2019s staff.\u00a0 The money can instead be paid to the CRF as it is not commercial to deal with it.Where the source and entitlement to the money cannot be ascertainedIn cases where the practitioner has been unable to identify the payer of money received in an administration account and, consequently, cannot confirm the person(s) who is entitled to the money, section 254 of the Bankruptcy Act has no application.\u00a0 However, this raises 2 questions for administrators:For how long is a practitioner expected to keep making attempts to identify the source of, and/or the person entitled to, the money?What should be done with the money after making appropriate but unsuccessful efforts to identify the source of the money and/or person entitled to it?The Inspector-General\u2019s expectation in this situation is that the practitioner will make every reasonable effort to identify the source of the money. \u00a0What is \u201creasonable\u201d will depend to a degree on the particular circumstances, but it is conceivable that a period of up to 12 months may be required for significant sums of money. \u00a0Money that remains unidentified despite reasonable efforts should be placed in a suspense account operated by the practitioner until the issue is resolved.The non-identification of money received by administrators can have significant consequences for a debtor who has a debt agreement in place because of the 3-month and 6-month arrears default (including non-completion 6 months after the date on which the agreement was due to be finalised) provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.\u00a0 This could mean that, where a debtor has paid the money to the practitioner but the practitioner has not been able to confirm the source, the money may be applied to the wrong debt agreement and/or the debtor who did pay the money may see their debt agreement incorrectly terminated by operation of law.\u00a0 As this is a significant consequence, practitioners administering debt agreements must ensure that all reasonable enquiries are made.How to pay money to the CommonwealthTo pay money to the CRF, the practitioner is to electronically transfer the money to the following account:Account nameAFSA Administered ReceiptsBSB062987Account number10001950Pursuant to section 72 of the Bankruptcy Regulations 2021, the practitioner making the payment must complete theapproved formand send it to theOfficial Receiver.\u00a0 The approved form, which came into effect on 1 April 2021, has been designed to capture all the information the Official Receiver may need when determining a claim to the money at a later date.[1]Practitioners are encouraged to provide all relevant details on the form because it will be referenced at a later date if a person makes a claim to the money and, if there is insufficient information for the Official Receiver to determine a claim, the practitioner may be required to provide more details at a later date.Copies of the approved form and the AFSA receipt are to be maintained on the practitioner\u2019s administration file.The expectations and role of the Inspector-GeneralPractitioners are expected to have systems and controls in place to identify when money has been unclaimed for 6 months and processes in place to attempt to locate payees.Section 12 of the Bankruptcy Act provides the Inspector-General with the power to conduct investigations. \u00a0Where there are issues of concern identified during the annual compliance program or when a complaint is made, delegates of the Inspector-General will examine the issue in relation to unclaimed money with reference to the principles set out in this practice document.Where breaches of the law or a lack of record keeping are identified, the practitioner will be asked to take remedial action. \u00a0This may also lead to counselling or, in serious cases, to either litigation or disciplinary action being initiated.\n\n",

            "For how long is a practitioner expected to keep making attempts to identify the source of, and/or the person entitled to, the money?\n\nWhat should be done with the money after making appropriate but unsuccessful efforts to identify the source of the money and/or person entitled to it?\n\nThe Inspector-General\u2019s expectation in this situation is that the practitioner will make every reasonable effort to identify the source of the money. \u00a0What is \u201creasonable\u201d will depend to a degree on the particular circumstances, but it is conceivable that a period of up to 12 months may be required for significant sums of money. \u00a0Money that remains unidentified despite reasonable efforts should be placed in a suspense account operated by the practitioner until the issue is resolved.\n\nThe non-identification of money received by administrators can have significant consequences for a debtor who has a debt agreement in place because of the 3-month and 6-month arrears default (including non-completion 6 months after the date on which the agreement was due to be finalised) provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.\u00a0 This could mean that, where a debtor has paid the money to the practitioner but the practitioner has not been able to confirm the source, the money may be applied to the wrong debt agreement and/or the debtor who did pay the money may see their debt agreement incorrectly terminated by operation of law.\u00a0 As this is a significant consequence, practitioners administering debt agreements must ensure that all reasonable enquiries are made.\n\nHow to pay money to the Commonwealth\n\nTo pay money to the CRF, the practitioner is to electronically transfer the money to the following account:Account nameAFSA Administered ReceiptsBSB062987Account number10001950\n\nAccount nameAFSA Administered ReceiptsBSB062987Account number10001950\n\nPursuant to section 72 of the Bankruptcy Regulations 2021, the practitioner making the payment must complete theapproved formand send it to theOfficial Receiver.\u00a0 The approved form, which came into effect on 1 April 2021, has been designed to capture all the information the Official Receiver may need when determining a claim to the money at a later date.[1]\n\nPractitioners are encouraged to provide all relevant details on the form because it will be referenced at a later date if a person makes a claim to the money and, if there is insufficient information for the Official Receiver to determine a claim, the practitioner may be required to provide more details at a later date.\n\nCopies of the approved form and the AFSA receipt are to be maintained on the practitioner\u2019s administration file.\n\nThe expectations and role of the Inspector-General\n\nPractitioners are expected to have systems and controls in place to identify when money has been unclaimed for 6 months and processes in place to attempt to locate payees.\n\nSection 12 of the Bankruptcy Act provides the Inspector-General with the power to conduct investigations. \u00a0Where there are issues of concern identified during the annual compliance program or when a complaint is made, delegates of the Inspector-General will examine the issue in relation to unclaimed money with reference to the principles set out in this practice document.\n\nWhere breaches of the law or a lack of record keeping are identified, the practitioner will be asked to take remedial action. \u00a0This may also lead to counselling or, in serious cases, to either litigation or disciplinary action being initiated.\n\nRefunds of unclaimed moneyWhere a person claims to be entitled to money that was paid to the CRF by a practitioner, an application can be made to the Official Receiver for a determination that the person is entitled to the money.\u00a0 Such an application is made pursuant to subsection 254(3) of the Bankruptcy Act.\u00a0 The Official Receiver will determine the application and, if satisfied that the person is entitled to the money and that the money has not already been paid out of the CRF, payment will be made.Examples of where this may be the case can include:where the claimant was a creditor in a bankrupt estate and where the trustee intended to pay a dividend to the creditor but was unable to locate themwhere there was money remaining in an administration that was due to be returned to a former bankrupt but where the former bankrupt could not be locatedwhere a person entitled to the money had died and a beneficiary of that person\u2019s estate claims the money.Making a claimWhere a person wishes to claim entitlement to money that was transferred to the CRF, the claim is to be submitted to the Official Receiver by using theunclaimed moneys online form.The form is an approved form, which means that it is required to be used in order to make a claim and no other form can be used in its place.\u00a0 Use of the form will also ensure that all necessary information is provided to enable the Official Receiver to consider the request.When the form has been completed, it is to be sent to the Official Receiver atregistry@afsa.gov.au(preferred) or via post to:Australian Financial Security AuthorityGPO Box 1550ADELAIDE\u00a0 SA\u00a0 5001The decision processFollowing receipt of the claim form, the Official Receiver will then consider the information provided on the form.Where further information or evidence is required, a request for this will be made within 28 business days.The Official Receiver will consider the information provided by the person and must be satisfied that the person is entitled to the money in order for a refund to be provided.\u00a0 The Official Receiver will take into account factors such as:if the person claims to be a creditor in an administration, whether the trustee admitted the claim and for how muchwhether the person\u2019s identity can be verifiedif the claim is being made on behalf of an entity, the person making the claim is authorised to act for the entity.As part of the decision process, the Official Receiver will consider the trustee\u2019sapproved formthat was provided to the Official Receiver when the money was paid to the CRF.Where additional information is required from the trustee regarding the payment of the money to the CRF, the Official Receiver will contact the trustee\u2019s office.\u00a0 This may need to occur in situations where:the trustee\u2019sapproved formwas deficientthe amount being claimed is significant and the Official Receiver requires additional information to make a decision with certainty.The Official Receiver will make a decision within 28 business days of receipt of all necessary information.Notifying the claimant of the Official Receiver\u2019s decisionWhere the Official Receiver is satisfied that the person who made the claim does have an entitlement to the money, or to part of the money claimed, the reasons for this decision and a notice of determination will be provided to the person.Where the Official Receiver is not satisfied that the person who made the claim does have an entitlement to the money, the reasons for this decision and a notice of determination will be provided to the person.\u00a0 A person whose claim was denied in full or in part has a right of review to the Court.Facilitating the refund to the claimantWhere a decision is made to refund an amount to the claimant, this will be processed as an account payable in the next AFSA departmental payment run.\u00a0 While the decision regarding the claimant\u2019s entitlement to the money will be made within 28 days of the receipt of all necessary evidence, the payment may take an additional 14 days to process.Refunds will be made via electronic funds transfer.Limitation of liabilityIt is the responsibility of the claimant to ensure that the financial institution account details provided in theunclaimed moneys claim formare accurate.\u00a0 Where a decision is made to refund an amount to the claimant, and where the money is transferred to the account specified in the claimant\u2019s form but where those account details were incorrect, the Official Receiver will not be liable.\u00a0 If that money is returned back to AFSA, the Official Receiver will take action to have them paid to the claimant; however, if the money is not returned to AFSA, the Official Receiver will take no further action.\n\n",

However, this period can be extended, generally to 5 or 8 years from the date of acceptance of the SOA, if the trustee files an objection to discharge.All trustees have the same powers to file objections in order to prompt bankrupts to comply with certain obligations under the Bankruptcy Act that, in turn, will assist the trustees in the administration of bankrupt estates.The relevant provisions of the Bankruptcy Act are:section 149A\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0 Bankruptcy extended when objection madesection 149B\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0 Objection to dischargesection 149C\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0 Form of notice of objectionsection 149D\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0 Grounds of objectionsection 149F\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0 Copy of notice of objection to be given to bankruptsection 149G\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0 Date of effect of objectionsection 149H\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0 Trustee ceasing to object on some groundssection 149J\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0 Withdrawal of objectionsection 149K\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0 Internal review of objectionsection 149Q\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0 Review of decisions.When lodgment of an objection is appropriateSection 149B of the Bankruptcy Act states that a trusteemayfile an objection at any time prior to a bankrupt\u2019s discharge and that the trusteemustfile an objection when the trustee believes that:doing so will help make the bankrupt discharge a duty that the bankrupt has not yet dischargedthere is no other way for the trustee to induce the bankrupt to discharge that duty.InNelson,[2]the court stated that:\u201c[I]n order to \u201ckeep a person bankrupt\u201d beyond the ordinary period, a trustee would need to have reasons directed to achievement of a purpose of the law of bankruptcy.\u00a0 The existence of a permissible ground supported by sufficient evidence is a threshold; there must also be reasonsjustifyingthe making of the objection in the particular case.\u201d(emphasis added)When a trustee exercises the discretion to object, \u201cthis presumption in favour of the bankrupt is foremost in the mind of the decision maker to be carefully weighed against any reasons for objecting to discharge.\u201d[3]Therefore, a trustee must properly consider thepurpose, utility and relevanceof objecting to a bankrupt\u2019s discharge.Grounds of objectionTo object to a bankrupt\u2019s discharge, the trustee must be satisfied that one (or more) of the grounds specified in subsection 149D(1) of the Bankruptcy Act applies.\u00a0 The ground(s) that applies will determine the period of extension of the bankruptcy.The grounds in subsection 149D(1) are listed inannexure A.In circumstances where an objection is filed under more than one ground in subsection 149D(1), the longer period provided for under subsection 149A(2) will apply (unless the objection on that ground is later withdrawn).Special grounds of objectionThose grounds with 8-year bankruptcy periods referred to in paragraphs 149D(1)(ab), (d), (da), (e), (f), (g), (h), (ha), (ia), (k) and (ma) are referred to as \u201cspecial grounds\u201d.\u00a0 (Note that paragraphs 149D(1)(ac) and (ad) also extend the bankruptcy to 8 years but are not special grounds, as they are not mentioned in subsection 149D(1A).)The Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Act 2002 (\u201cBLAA\u201d) introduced the special grounds of objection into the Bankruptcy Act.\u00a0 Paragraph 51 of the Explanatory Memorandum to the BLAA stated:\u201c[\u2026] Special grounds are directed todeliberate actions by the bankrupt to defeat creditors or hinder the trustee\u2019s administration.\u00a0 The bankrupt\u2019s pre-objection conduct, rather than the trustee\u2019s capacity to show that an objection will advance the conduct of an administration, will determine whether any notice of objection will have to state the reasons(s) why it has been lodged. [\u2026]\u201d(emphasis added)The above extract makes clear that the bankrupt\u2019s conduct alone \u2013 and not the trustee\u2019s ability to show that an objection might rectify that conduct \u2013 is critical to whether an objection on special grounds is appropriate.Despite the content of the Explanatory Memorandum noted above, there are some special grounds that, if not invoked with sufficient justification, could be viewed as punitive in nature.\u00a0 An example is an objection filed under paragraph 149D(1)(ab) of the Bankruptcy Act where a bankrupt has engaged in an undervalued transaction or a transfer to defeat creditors, where no actions by the bankrupt after the date of bankruptcy can undo the previous conduct that resulted in the transaction or transfer; however, filing an objection may be appropriate to encourage the bankrupt to discharge duties relevant to the trustee\u2019s investigation, such as providing information and documentation sought by the trustee.\u00a0 It can also act as a deterrent to others from engaging in similar conduct.\n\n",

            "The Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Act 2002 (\u201cBLAA\u201d) introduced the special grounds of objection into the Bankruptcy Act.\u00a0 Paragraph 51 of the Explanatory Memorandum to the BLAA stated:\u201c[\u2026] Special grounds are directed todeliberate actions by the bankrupt to defeat creditors or hinder the trustee\u2019s administration.\u00a0 The bankrupt\u2019s pre-objection conduct, rather than the trustee\u2019s capacity to show that an objection will advance the conduct of an administration, will determine whether any notice of objection will have to state the reasons(s) why it has been lodged. [\u2026]\u201d(emphasis added)\n\nThe above extract makes clear that the bankrupt\u2019s conduct alone \u2013 and not the trustee\u2019s ability to show that an objection might rectify that conduct \u2013 is critical to whether an objection on special grounds is appropriate.\n\nDespite the content of the Explanatory Memorandum noted above, there are some special grounds that, if not invoked with sufficient justification, could be viewed as punitive in nature.\u00a0 An example is an objection filed under paragraph 149D(1)(ab) of the Bankruptcy Act where a bankrupt has engaged in an undervalued transaction or a transfer to defeat creditors, where no actions by the bankrupt after the date of bankruptcy can undo the previous conduct that resulted in the transaction or transfer; however, filing an objection may be appropriate to encourage the bankrupt to discharge duties relevant to the trustee\u2019s investigation, such as providing information and documentation sought by the trustee.\u00a0 It can also act as a deterrent to others from engaging in similar conduct.\n\nHow an objection is prepared and filedThe requirements as to what an objection to discharge must contain are outlined in section 149C of the Bankruptcy Act.\u00a0 There is no approved form for a notice of objection to discharge.The Official Receiver encourages trustees to file objections usingAFSA\u2019s Online Services portal.\u00a0 Seeannexure Bfor some information about using the portal.GroundsThe objection to discharge must outline the subsection 149D(1) ground or grounds under which it was filed.While subsection 149C(2) of the Bankruptcy Act states that an objection to discharge is not invalid merely because it does not state the ground(s) of the objection, provided that the ground(s) can be reasonably identified from the content of the objection, AFSA expects that a trustee will not file an objection that does not clearly outline the relevant ground(s).EvidenceThe trustee is required by paragraph 149C(1)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act to outline the evidence on which the decision to file the objection was based.The trustee will need to provide sufficient evidence to establish that the bankrupt was given an opportunity to comply with an obligation under the Bankruptcy Act and failed to do so without a reasonable excuse or, in the case of a special ground relating to past conduct, that the conduct did occur and that it supports lodgment of an objection on the relevant ground(s).The objection should enable a bankrupt to identify and, if needed, search out the evidence or other material relied on to support it.[4]The evidence must also be set out precisely, be relevant to and clearly identify the ground(s) of objection.\u00a0 These requirements will be considered by AFSA if the objection to discharge is subject to review.When filing an objection on special grounds, it is helpful if the trustee references in the objection any warning(s) given to the bankrupt.The specific evidence that needs to be referenced to support lodgment of an objection will vary depending on the ground or grounds of the objection.\u00a0 The evidence may comprise:details of documents and/or information requested by the trusteedates that documents and/or information were requested and how the requests were madethe due dates on which the documents and/or information were to be provided to the trusteedetails of any communications with the bankrupt about the trustee\u2019s requests for documents and/or informationdetails, dates and amounts of income contribution assessmentsamounts, dates and details of income contribution instalments paid as at the time an objection is filedinformation about the nature, location and value of property that is the subject of the trustee\u2019s investigations, including property being investigated under the antecedent transaction provisions of the Bankruptcy Actdetails of overseas travel undertaken by the bankrupt, including dates of travel, destinations and any discussions between the bankrupt and the trustee about traveldetails of the bankrupt\u2019s beneficial interest in property and information about relevant trusts or a deceased estatethe names of creditors and the dates debts were incurred in relation to liabilities that were not disclosed to the trusteedates of meetings or examinations scheduled by the trustee and information regarding the methods by which the bankrupt was notified of the dates and requirements to attend.ReasonsWhere an objection is filed on a non-special ground, paragraph 149C(1)(c) of the Bankruptcy Act requires the trustee to outline their reasons for an objection.Objections based on non-special grounds will therefore need to specify the ground(s), evidence and reasons that apply.\u00a0 While the ground(s) and evidence will outline either the obligation(s) that was not satisfied and the compliance opportunities afforded to the bankrupt or the previous conduct that supports the ground(s) of objection, the reasons must go beyond this.Cases decided by the courts have held that the reasons must be:more than a recitation of the ground in subsection 149D(1)[5]directly linked to the relevant ground(s) and not merely outline the consequences of an objection being filed[6]enable the bankrupt to know the answer to the question \u201cwhy are you objecting on this ground to my discharge?\u201d.[7]AFSA expects the trustee to clearly set out in the reasons how the ground(s) of objection is meant to achieve the relevant purpose for which the trustee is objecting (i.e. the utility of lodging the objection).The reasons for lodging an objection may include but are not limited to the following:the bankrupt\u2019s fundamental obligations under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Actspecific obligations under certain other provisions of the Bankruptcy Actdetails of further information linking the conduct establishing the connection between the ground(s) and the breach(es) of the duties referred to abovethe trustee\u2019s duty under paragraph 19(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act to take whatever action is practicable to try to ensure that the bankrupt discharges all of his or her duties under the Bankruptcy Acthow the bankrupt\u2019s actions have hindered the trustee\u2019s investigations and, consequently, the trustee\u2019s obligations under paragraphs 19(1)(b) and (f) of the Bankruptcy Act regarding propertythe inappropriate entitlement to the benefit of automatic discharge under the Bankruptcy Act, considering the bankrupt\u2019s interference with the trustee\u2019s compliance with their dutiesthe benefit the extended bankruptcy period will afford the trustee, considering the bankrupt\u2019s failure to assist the trusteethe potential outcomes of ongoing investigationsto provide the bankrupt the opportunity to cooperate more fully with the trustee in the administration of their estateto enable the bankrupt to comprehensively meet their obligations to be forthcoming and frank in the information provided to the trustee, particularly when their obligation of full disclosure and duty to assist the trustee to the utmost of their power would be significantly reduced if they were to be discharged from bankruptcythe protection that will be afforded to credit providers from the actions of the bankrupt by extending the bankruptcyas a matter of public interest by ensuring that a bankrupt meets their requirements of transparency and candour under the Bankruptcy Act, so as to assist the trustee to the utmost of their power.Advising the bankrupt of their right of reviewAFSA expects that every objection will include a statement that the bankrupt may request a review of the trustee\u2019s decision to file the objection.\u00a0 As required by subsection 149K(3) of the Bankruptcy Act, this statement must also advise the bankrupt that a request for review must be:made in writing to AFSAmade within 60 calendar days after being notified of the trustee\u2019s objectionaccompanied with a copy of the notice of objection and any documents on which the bankrupt relies in support of the request for review.Words to the effect shown below should be included in each objection to discharge filed by trustees:\u201cYou may request that the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy (AFSA) review the trustee\u2019s decision to object to your discharge.\u00a0 Your request must be in writing and must be filed with AFSA not later than 60 calendar days after the day on which you are notified of the trustee\u2019s objection to your discharge.\u00a0 Your request must be accompanied by a copy of the notice of objection and any documents on which you rely in support of your request.\u00a0 Further information about how to request a review is available from AFSA on 1300 364 785 or atwww.afsa.gov.au.\u201dWhen an objection becomes effectiveAn objection to discharge must be filed with the Official Receiver so that it can be registered on the National Personal Insolvency Index (\u201cNPII\u201d).Section 149G of the Bankruptcy Act provides for an objection taking effect on the beginning of the day that the details of the notice are entered on the NPII.An objection can be recorded on the NPII provided that the notice was filed by the trustee with the Official Receiverbeforethe debtor became discharged.Trustees may consider checking the NPII after filing the objection to ensure it accurately reflects the objection details.Notifying the bankrupt of the objectionSection 149F of the Bankruptcy Act requires the trustee to give a copy of the objection to the bankrupt \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d after it is filed with the Official Receiver.\u00a0 AFSA expects this to be done within 7 days of the objection being filed with the Official Receiver.The trustee may give a copy of the objection to the bankrupt by many methods (see section 102 of the Regulations), including:sending it by post or courier service to the bankrupt\u2019s last-known addressleaving it in an envelope or similar package marked with the bankrupt\u2019s name (and any relevant document exchange number) at the place where the bankrupt maintains a document exchange facilityleaving it in an envelope (or similar package) marked with the bankrupt\u2019s name at his or her last-known addressdelivering it personally to the bankruptsending by it facsimile or another mode of electronic transmission:to a facility maintained by the bankrupt to receive electronically transmitted documentsin such a manner (such as email) that the document should, in the ordinary course of events, be received by the bankrupt.Where a bankrupt has a history of disputing receipt of the trustee\u2019s correspondence, Registered Post is recommended if sending a copy of the objection by post, with the delivery confirmation to be placed on the administration file.When the bankrupt\u2019s address is unknownIn some administrations, the bankrupt\u2019s postal and email addresses are both unknown, and there is no current telephone number on file to facilitate contacting the bankrupt.\u00a0 Lodging an objection to discharge may still be appropriate in this situation because, when the bankrupt is later notified of the objection, they may be induced to comply with their obligations.Although subsection 149F(3) of the Bankruptcy Act states that a trustee\u2019s failure to notify the bankrupt of an objection as soon as practicable does not invalidate the objection, AFSA expects the trustee to notify the bankrupt as soon as a postal or email address becomes known.The bankrupt\u2019s review rights are not affected by the objection not being provided to him or her immediately, as the 60-day review period commences when the bankrupt is notified of the objection.Trustee\u2019s recordA copy of the objection must be placed on the trustee\u2019s file for review and inspection purposes.[8]National Personal Insolvency Index recordDivision 2 of theBankruptcy Regulations 2021(\u201cthe Regulations\u201d) requires objections to discharge to be recorded on the

consistent with an objection being used as a last resort.Transfers void against the trusteeFor an objection based on paragraph 149D(1)(aa) of the Bankruptcy Act, the trustee must show that section 120 or 122 applies.\u00a0 In the case of an objection filed in relation to an undervalued transaction (section 120), AFSA expects the trustee to outline whether the benefits of voiding the transfer would exceed the costs of doing so (see section 31 of the Regulations) and to have at least begun some form of recovery action.For an objection based on paragraph 149D(1)(ab) of the Bankruptcy Act, the trustee must show that there has been a transfer to defeat creditors (under section 121).\u00a0 AFSA expects the trustee to show, among other things, that:the bankrupt\u2019s main purpose of the transfer was to prevent the property becoming divisible (noting that the bankrupt\u2019s main purpose is taken to be this purpose if they were insolvent or were about to become insolvent at the time of the transfer)the trustee has at least begun recovery action in some form (although not essential).Misleading conductFor an objection based on paragraph 149D(1)(c) of the Bankruptcy Act, the trustee must show that the bankrupt has engaged in one or more forms of misleading conduct set out in section 148 and that the amount involved exceeded the applicableindexed amount.\u00a0 Providing false or misleading information can occur by action or omission.Providing false or misleading informationFor an objection under paragraph 149D(1)(da) of the Bankruptcy Act, the trustee must show that the bankrupt acted intentionally.\u00a0 Intention is a state of mind which may be established by direct evidence or inferred from the surrounding circumstances.[9]Providing false or misleading information can occur by action or omission.Failure to provide informationFor an objection based on paragraph 149D(1)(d) of the Bankruptcy Act, 5 distinct elements must be fulfilled:the request must be to the bankrupt (element 1)the request must be in writing (element 2)the request must be by the trustee (element 3)the request must be to provide written information (element 4)the information requested must be about the bankrupt\u2019s property, income or expected income (element 5).In Jones[10], the ART considered paragraph 149D(1)(d) and required strict compliance as opposed to \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with each of its 5 constituent elements.\u00a0 This is due to the serious consequences for a bankrupt person who is found to have failed to provide information.\u00a0 The ART stated that a request under paragraph 149D(1)(d) is \u201cnot dissimilar in seriousness to a failure to comply with a bankruptcy notice\u201d ([73]) and, just as the law requires strict compliance with the statutory requirements for a bankruptcy notice (seeKleinwort Benson Australia Ltd v Crowl[1988] HCA 34; (1988) 165 CLR 71), similar strict standards should be applied \u201cwith respect to form and content of other notices where the consequences of non-compliance are serious\u201d ([73]).For the paragraph 149D(1)(d) ground to exist, not only must the request be to the bankrupt and be in writing, but it must come from the trustee (not a member of the trustee\u2019s staff) and it must explicitly request information to be provided in writing and must be about the bankrupt\u2019s property, income or expected income.\u00a0 In the case of the Official Trustee, the request must have come from an officer with appropriate delegation and authorisation.Only one request need be made where the trustee seeks to obtain information from a bankrupt, provided the request outlines the fact that an objection to discharge may be filed if the bankrupt does not comply with the request by a specified date.The trustee must consider whether the bankrupt has been provided with a reasonable opportunity to comply.\u00a0 In Wharton,[11]the following was said about the power of objection under section 149A:\u201c[\u2026] It provides a strong incentive to bankrupts to co-operate with their trustees during the administration of their estates.\u00a0 In some circumstances, an incentive of that type is plainly necessary.\u00a0 However, unless the section is construed in a sensible manner, it is capable of operating oppressively.\u00a0 It is reasonable to assume that trustees who make requests for information from bankrupts, including those concerning their income, will make due allowance for what might be regarded as the ordinary exigencies of life.\u00a0 Requests for information are often not met in as timely a manner as they ought to be.\u00a0 Some delays may be regarded as excusable while others will properly give rise to the filing of notices of objection.\u00a0 A bankrupt cannot ignore requests from his or her trustee.\u00a0 A particularly lengthy delay in responding to a request may trigger a notice of objection to discharge which is entirely justifiable.\u00a0 A relatively short delay in answering a request may be a different matter.\u00a0 Section 149D(1)(d) must be construed in the light of the requirement in s 149B(2)(b) that the trustee must believe that the filing of a notice of objection is the only way to induce the bankrupt to discharge his duties under the Act.It is plainly a course of last resort.\u201d(emphasis added)The Administrative Review Tribunal (\u201cART\u201d) has held that a bankrupt referring a request from the trustee to an agent in possession of certain documents is sufficient action on the part of the bankrupt.[12]In this situation, an objection would not be appropriate because the bankrupt has made a reasonable attempt to comply; however, where the bankrupt does not follow up with the agent after several months, lodging an objection may induce the bankrupt to take further action to comply with the trustee\u2019s request.A bankrupt is taken to have failed to comply with a request to provide information if the bankrupt has provided information that is incomplete or inaccurate (see section 45 of the Regulations).\u00a0 It is directed at deliberate actions by the bankrupt to defeat creditors or hinder the trustee\u2019s administration of the estate.[13]Example 1Melissa disclosed the sale of a property 2 years prior to bankruptcy on her statement of affairs.\u00a0 Melissa\u2019s trustee wrote to her and requested that a copy of the settlement statement and banking records showing how the surplus was spent be supplied within 14 days.\u00a0 The letter advised that a written response was required and advised Melissa that, if she did not respond within 14 days, the trustee would file an objection to discharge that would extend her bankruptcy from 3 to 8 years from when her SOA was accepted.No reply was received within 14 days.\u00a0 On the 15th day, Melissa was contacted via telephone and reminded to submit the required information.\u00a0 Melissa said that the information would be supplied in the next few days and the trustee agreed to allow her an extra 5 days to comply with the request.When no response was received after a further 5 days, the trustee filed an objection to discharge relying on the ground at paragraph 149D(1)(d):\u201cThe bankrupt, when requested in writing by the trustee to provide written information about the bankrupt\u2019s property, income or expected income, failed to comply with the request.\u201dWhile the trustee was not required to afford Melissa the additional 5 days to comply with the original request, the trustee agreeing to this meant that it would not be appropriate to lodge an objection before the expiration of this time frame.Failure to disclose incomeFor an objection under paragraph 149D(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy Act, the trustee may ask the bankrupt to complete an income questionnaire.\u00a0 The due date for this information should not be before 21 days after the end of the CAP, as specified in section 139U, and it is expected that the bankrupt will be warned that failure to comply may result in an objection being filed.Where the trustee requests that evidence of the bankrupt\u2019s income be provided earlier than 21 days after the end of the CAP, it is not appropriate for a trustee to file an objection until the 21-day period has passed and where the evidence has still not been provided at that date.\u00a0 If an objection is filed prior to the 21-day period coming to an end, the ground will be cancelled by AFSA on review.Example 2Ella became bankrupt on 1 April 2020.\u00a0 Contribution assessment period 1 therefore ran from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021.On 1 February 2021, the trustee wrote to Ella and instructed her to provide evidence of her income for CAP1 by 22 February 2021.\u00a0 Ella did not provide the information at this time.As section 139U of the Bankruptcy Act provides Ella until 21 April 2021 to provide evidence of her income, it is not appropriate for the trustee to file an objection on23 February 2021 when it was confirmed that Ella had not complied with the letter of1 February.\u00a0 Rather, if evidence of Ella\u2019s income has still not been provided by21 April, this would be the earliest date on which the trustee could have filed an objection.Failure to pay income contributionsFor an objection under paragraph 149D(1)(f) of the Bankruptcy Act to be defensible, the trustee must have given the bankrupt at least 14 days\u2019 clear notice to make the first payment, as required by section 139ZI of the Bankruptcy Act.Not providing a period of at least 14 days to pay the contribution liability, or to pay the first instalment if the trustee has permitted the bankrupt to pay by instalments, will result in the ground being cancelled by AFSA on review.Example 3Kane\u2019s trustee assessed him as liable to pay income contributions of $10,000 for contribution assessment period 2 in accordance with section 139ZI of the Bankruptcy Act.\u00a0 A notice of this assessment was sent to Kane by both email and post on Monday 11 October 2021, advising him that the first instalment of $1000 was due on or before Friday 22 October 2021.Kane failed to pay the first instalment by 22 October.\u00a0 The trustee\u2019s staff contacted the bankrupt by phone about the missed instalment and a letter was also sent that advised Kane that he was in arrears and that he had a further 14 days to rectify this.When Kane did not pay the arrears by the extended due date, the trustee filed an objection to discharge.\u00a0 Kane applied to AFSA for review of the objection and AFSA was obligated to cancel the objection, as the notice of assessment that required payment was not issued in accordance with section 139ZI and was therefore invalid.Failure to disclose a liabilityFor an objection based on paragraph 149D(1)(ha) of the Bankruptcy Act, the trustee must show that the bankrupt acted intentionally.\u00a0 As noted above, intention is a state of mind which may be established by direct evidence or inferred from the surrounding circumstances.InArundell,[14]a bankrupt failed to disclose a particular debt to the trustee.\u00a0 The bankrupt argued that it was not intentional as he regarded the debt as a \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d and believed that, by not disclosing it, the creditor could claim the full amount from him personally.\u00a0 The ART found that the bankrupt\u2019s desire to keep the debt unaffected by the bankruptcy was a conscious decision not to disclose a debt and therefore affirmed the ground of objection.For an objection based on paragraph 149D(1)(i), reasons are required.\u00a0 Trustees may wish to consider that there is a clear responsibility placed on the bankrupt to disclose all liabilities, even if the trustee may have obtained knowledge of the liability from some other source.\n\n",

            "When a statement of affairs has not been filedWhere a person is made bankrupt by sequestration order, they have an obligation under section 54 of the Bankruptcy Act to file a SOA with the Official Receiver.It is AFSA\u2019s view that the Bankruptcy Act does not specifically contemplate lodging an objection to discharge where a sequestration order has been made and the bankrupt has not yet filed a SOA.\u00a0 As a result, AFSA expects that a trustee will not file an objection for the failure to file a SOA until after the trustee has exercised other powers available under the Bankruptcy Act to induce compliance.Deliberate or intentional failure to file SOASome trustees have relied on the special ground in paragraph 149D(1)(d) of the Bankruptcy Act to support an objection filed for the bankrupt\u2019s failure or ongoing refusal to file a SOA. \u00a0However, for this to be a valid, a trustee would need to show the bankrupt\u2019s conduct was deliberate, as opposed to just lacking knowledge, lacking awareness of their bankrupt status, inadvertence etc.[15]Regardless, the objection regime is not intended to be used by trustees for this purpose.Since the Bankruptcy Act amendments in 2002, the bankrupt\u2019s pre-objection conduct alone, as described in the special grounds, can determine whether an objection should be filed, without any reason for the objection having to be stated.\u00a0 A trustee needs to be satisfied by relevant evidence of deliberate attempts by the bankrupt to defeat creditors or to hinder the administration by failing or refusing to file a SOA.A bankrupt is obliged to aid, to their utmost power, the trustee\u2019s administration of their estate.[16]This imposes an ongoing responsibility on bankrupts to cooperate with their trustee.\u00a0 In the event of non-compliance, the law is ultimately enforced by criminal investigation, followed by potential prosecution action and court sanctions.A bankrupt may convince AFSA on review that, despite apparent evidence to the contrary, there was a reasonable excuse for the failure constituting the special ground.[17]Offence referral and penalty regimeThe Bankruptcy Act provides a mechanism to enforce compliance by penalty notice for a bankrupt failing to file a SOA.\u00a0 The current penalty for non-compliance with section 54 of the Bankruptcy Act is 50 penalty units which is at least $11,100.With reference to trustees\u2019 duties in paragraphs 19(1)(h) and (i) of the Bankruptcy Act to refer offences to AFSA, circumstances in which a trustee is expected to refer a bankrupt\u2019s non-lodgment of a SOA are detailed inReferring offences against theBankruptcy Act 1966to the Inspector-General.Section 305 funding applicationsA trustee who is unable to locate a bankrupt to obtain a completed SOA may consider applying to the Commonwealth for funding.Legal and Governance Guideline: The provision of funding for trustees under section 305 of theBankruptcy Act 1966and theapplication formare available on the AFSA website.Sections 77CA, 77C and 81A trustee may seek to utilise section 77CA, 77C and/or 81 of the Bankruptcy Act to obtain a completed statement of affairs.AFSA acknowledges that section 77C notices and section 81 examinations involve added cost and require the trustee to exercise discretionary powers, professional judgment and experience in the most efficient and effective manner.\u00a0 Further, while section 77CA notices do not incur an application fee, there may be circumstances preventing the issue of the notice.\u00a0 As such, these options may not be able to be pursued but it is expected that they will be considered before an objection is filed for non-filing of a SOA.ExamplesThe following examples are to provide guidance regarding when an objection to discharge is and is not appropriate in relation to the non-filing of a SOA.Example 4: Inappropriate objection to dischargeJulian was made bankrupt by sequestration order.\u00a0 The trustee is unable to locate him and, as such, he may not be aware of his bankrupt status.\u00a0 In accordance with section 54 of the Bankruptcy Act, the trustee sent a letter to Julian\u2019s last known address, requesting that he complete and file a SOA within 14 days.\u00a0 On the 15th day after getting no response, the trustee filed an objection with the Official Receiver.The trustee had not considered the alternative courses of action above (a section 305 application, a section 77C notice and an offence referral) to obtain a completed SOA from Julian.As the trustee has not acted within the scheme and purpose of the Bankruptcy Act as outlined above, lodgment of an objection is not appropriate at this time.Example 5: The bankrupt deliberately does not file a SOASoraya\u2019s present location is known and the trustee has the following evidence on file:an affidavit from a process server, verifying that Soraya was served a letter when she lived at a previous address that advised her of her bankruptcy and her obligation to file a SOAfile notes detailing several discussions with Soraya, in which she confirmed that she was aware of the bankruptcy and her obligation to file a SOA.Soraya continually ignores the trustee\u2019s phone calls and has still not filed her SOA.The trustee has pursued alternative courses of action listed above (an offence referral, a section 305 application and a section 77C notice), but these have proven unsuccessful.\u00a0 After taking these steps, the trustee files an objection.In this case, the trustee has acted in accordance with the scheme and purpose of the Bankruptcy Act.\u00a0 This example also gives rise to the expectation that the trustee would additionally refer any such non-compliance to AFSA, alleging a breach of section 54 of the Bankruptcy Act, in order to the trustee to satisfy his obligations under paragraphs 19(1)(h) and (i) of the Bankruptcy Act.\n\n",

to refer a bankrupt\u2019s non-lodgment of a SOA are detailed inReferring offences against theBankruptcy Act 1966to the Inspector-General.\n\nSection 305 funding applications\n\nA trustee who is unable to locate a bankrupt to obtain a completed SOA may consider applying to the Commonwealth for funding.Legal and Governance Guideline: The provision of funding for trustees under section 305 of theBankruptcy Act 1966and theapplication formare available on the AFSA website.\n\nSections 77CA, 77C and 81\n\nA trustee may seek to utilise section 77CA, 77C and/or 81 of the Bankruptcy Act to obtain a completed statement of affairs.\n\nAFSA acknowledges that section 77C notices and section 81 examinations involve added cost and require the trustee to exercise discretionary powers, professional judgment and experience in the most efficient and effective manner.\u00a0 Further, while section 77CA notices do not incur an application fee, there may be circumstances preventing the issue of the notice.\u00a0 As such, these options may not be able to be pursued but it is expected that they will be considered before an objection is filed for non-filing of a SOA.\n\nExamples\n\nThe following examples are to provide guidance regarding when an objection to discharge is and is not appropriate in relation to the non-filing of a SOA.Example 4: Inappropriate objection to dischargeJulian was made bankrupt by sequestration order.\u00a0 The trustee is unable to locate him and, as such, he may not be aware of his bankrupt status.\u00a0 In accordance with section 54 of the Bankruptcy Act, the trustee sent a letter to Julian\u2019s last known address, requesting that he complete and file a SOA within 14 days.\u00a0 On the 15th day after getting no response, the trustee filed an objection with the Official Receiver.The trustee had not considered the alternative courses of action above (a section 305 application, a section 77C notice and an offence referral) to obtain a completed SOA from Julian.As the trustee has not acted within the scheme and purpose of the Bankruptcy Act as outlined above, lodgment of an objection is not appropriate at this time.Example 5: The bankrupt deliberately does not file a SOASoraya\u2019s present location is known and the trustee has the following evidence on file:an affidavit from a process server, verifying that Soraya was served a letter when she lived at a previous address that advised her of her bankruptcy and her obligation to file a SOAfile notes detailing several discussions with Soraya, in which she confirmed that she was aware of the bankruptcy and her obligation to file a SOA.Soraya continually ignores the trustee\u2019s phone calls and has still not filed her SOA.The trustee has pursued alternative courses of action listed above (an offence referral, a section 305 application and a section 77C notice), but these have proven unsuccessful.\u00a0 After taking these steps, the trustee files an objection.In this case, the trustee has acted in accordance with the scheme and purpose of the Bankruptcy Act.\u00a0 This example also gives rise to the expectation that the trustee would additionally refer any such non-compliance to AFSA, alleging a breach of section 54 of the Bankruptcy Act, in order to the trustee to satisfy his obligations under paragraphs 19(1)(h) and (i) of the Bankruptcy Act.\n\n",

and(b)\u00a0 if:(i)\u00a0 \u00a0the period specified in whichever of subsections 149(2), (3) and (4) applies in relation to the bankrupt has ended; and(ii)\u00a0 no other objection against the discharge of the bankrupt is in effect;the bankrupt is taken to be discharged under section 149 immediately the objection is withdrawn or cancelled.AFSA expects trustees to inform bankrupts of their ongoing duties after discharge under the Bankruptcy Act to assist with the administration of their estate and pay any outstanding income contributions.\u00a0 AFSA also expects bankrupts be advised at the commencement of the administration, and as appropriate at the time of discharge that:assets forming part of their estate do not revert back to them upon dischargethe trustee maintains the right to realise or otherwise dispose of them.Finalising the administration of an estate when an objection is in placeWhen deciding to finalise the administration of an estate where an objection to discharge has been filed, AFSA expects the trustee to consider whether it is still appropriate for the objection to remain.Trustees should consider if finalising the administration would reasonably lead to the conclusion that the bankrupt\u2019s cooperation is no longer required.\u00a0 This means that, if the trustee still requires the bankrupt to discharge a particular obligation, it may be inappropriate to finalise the matter.\u00a0 The filing of an objection should not be the reason for prolonging the administration indefinitely if it does not have the desired effect.Where the administration of an estate has been finalised while an objection remains, the trustee needs to be seen to take action to encourage the bankrupt\u2019s compliance with obligations under the Bankruptcy Act.\u00a0 As an officer of the court, it is prudent for the trustee to consider the interests of the bankrupt, creditors and the community generally.[18]This includes taking reasonable steps to assist all bankrupts to discharge their obligations, especially when returns to creditors may result.Where the bankrupt is a contributor and an objection has been filed due to arrears in CAP1, 2 or 3, it may be appropriate for the trustee to withdraw the objection when the bankrupt has paid the entire amount owed for each period and is up to date with payments in the current CAP, particularly if the trustee is confident that the assessment is accurate and the bankrupt has not underestimated their income.National Personal Insolvency Index recordWhen an objection withdrawal has been recorded by the Official Receiver, the NPII will record the objection having been withdrawn.\n\n",

reasonably lead to the conclusion that the bankrupt\u2019s cooperation is no longer required.\u00a0 This means that, if the trustee still requires the bankrupt to discharge a particular obligation, it

steps to assist all bankrupts to discharge their obligations, especially when returns to creditors may result.\n\nWhere the bankrupt is a contributor and an objection has been filed due to arrears in

withdrawal has been recorded by the Official Receiver, the NPII will record the objection having been withdrawn.\n\nRight of reviewReview by AFSAA bankrupt wishing to request review of a trustee\u2019s decision to file an objection by AFSA is encouraged to use theonline review of objection form.\u00a0 The review will be conducted by AFSA, and section 149K of the Bankruptcy Act requires the request for review to be filed with AFSA:Internal review of objectionThe Inspector-General may review a decision of the trustee to file a notice of objection\u2026(3)\u00a0 A request by the bankrupt to the Inspector-General for the review of such a decision must:(a)\u00a0 be in writing and given to the Inspector-General not later than 60 days after the day on which the bankrupt is notified of the trustee\u2019s objectionWhen conducting a review, AFSA will review the decision to object and the notice of objection to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Bankruptcy Act. \u00a0AFSA can ask the bankrupt and/or the trustee for further information to assist with the review process. \u00a0In appropriate circumstances, AFSA may seek to facilitate a resolution of the issues in dispute between the trustee and the bankrupt.In accordance with paragraph 149N(1A)(c) of the Bankruptcy Act, AFSA will consider whether the bankrupt has a reasonable excuse when reviewing an objection filed on special grounds.\u00a0 The lack of any warning may, depending on the circumstances, amount to a reasonable excuse by the bankrupt and a basis for AFSA to cancel the objection.[19]Where additional evidence is provided that will be relied upon by AFSA in making a decision or where existing evidence has been challenged, the trustee and the bankrupt will be given the opportunity to respond to the fresh evidence or issues raised as a matter of natural justice.When conducting the objection review,\u00a0AFSA will consider the following:Is the ground(s) of objection on which the objection was made a ground(s) specified in subsection 149D(1) of the Bankruptcy Act?Is there sufficient evidence to support the existence of the ground(s) of objection?Where the objection is based on a non-special ground, do the reasons given for objecting on that ground(s) justify the making of the objection?If AFSA is not satisfied as to one or all of the elements listed in the preceding paragraph, and where there is no special ground that has been upheld, the objection must be cancelled.Review of a special ground of objectionReview of an objection is addressed in section 149N of the Bankruptcy Act.\u00a0 This section states in part:Decision on review(1)\u00a0 On a review of a decision, if the Inspector-General is satisfied that:(a)\u00a0 the ground or grounds on which the objection was made was not a ground or were not grounds specified in subsection 149D(1); or(b)\u00a0 there is insufficient evidence to support the existence of the ground or grounds of objection; or(c)\u00a0 the reasons given for objecting on that ground or those grounds do not justify the making of the objection; or(d)\u00a0 a previous objection that was made on that ground or those grounds, or on grounds that included that ground or those grounds, was cancelled;the Inspector-General must cancel the objection.(1A)\u00a0 An objection must not be cancelled under subsection (1) if:(a)\u00a0 the objection specifies at least one special ground; and(b)\u00a0 there is sufficient evidence to support the existence of at least one special ground specified in the objection; and(c)\u00a0 the bankrupt fails to establish that the bankrupt had a reasonable excuse for the conduct or failure that constituted the special ground.For this purpose, special ground means a ground specified in paragraph 149D(1)(ab), (d), (da), (e), (f), (g), (h), (ha), (ia), (k) or (ma).(1B)\u00a0 In applying subsection (1A), no notice is to be taken of any conduct of the bankrupt after the time when the ground concerned first commenced to exist.The effect of subsection 149N(1A) is to limit the review by AFSA of an objection based on a special ground.\u00a0 The review is limited to considering only evidence of the special ground and failure of the bankrupt to establish a reasonable excuse.In the situation where an objection was filed on more than one ground and where one special ground is upheld by AFSA, the objection cannot be cancelled.\u00a0 AFSA is not required to then consider any additional ground(s) of objection as part of its review.[20]Review of an ordinary (non-special) ground of objectionWhere an objection is filed on an ordinary ground, the trustee must specify a reason for the making of the objection on that ground. \u00a0The objection must not be filed to punish the bankrupt but must set out what purpose it seeks to achieve. \u00a0It must state how the extension of the period of bankruptcy will provide a utility not otherwise available were the bankrupt to be discharged from bankruptcy.The courts have considered the following examples to be valid reasons demonstrating utility in certain circumstances:to provide the bankrupt the opportunity to co-operate more fully with the trustee in the administration of their estate and to comprehensively meet their obligations to be forthcoming and frank in the information provided to the trustee, particularly when their obligation of full disclosure and duty to assist the trustee to the utmost of their power would be significantly reduced if they were to be discharged from bankruptcyas a matter of public interest by ensuring that a bankrupt meets their requirements of transparency and candour under the Bankruptcy Act, so as to assist the trustee to the utmost of their power.Cancellation of an objectionWhere an objection is cancelled by AFSA, the cancellation does not take effect until either:the end of 28 days from the date that the bankrupt and the trustee receive AFSA\u2019s decision, being the period within which an application can be made for a review of that decision to the ART, orif such an application is made, the date the decision of the ART is given.Review of AFSA\u2019s decisionFollowing the review of a decision by AFSA, the bankrupt or trustee can apply to the ART for review if dissatisfied with the outcome.\u00a0 If an application for review is made within time and AFSA refuses to perform a review, this decision is also able to be reviewed by application to the ART.The ART appeal process requires an application to be made in writing in accordance with the prescribed application form available from theART website. \u00a0The application must set out a statement of reasons for the application and be made within 28 days of receipt of AFSA Practitioner Surveillance decision.National Personal Insolvency Index recordAFSA (the Inspector-General) will advise the Official Receiver when an objection has been cancelled so that

record\n\nAFSA (the Inspector-General) will advise the Official Receiver when an objection has been cancelled so that the National Personal Insolvency Index can be updated.\n\nOther considerationsThe trustee is required to act in a timely mannerA trustee is expected to carry out their duties in a timely manner.\u00a0 The power to object to a bankrupt\u2019s discharge is not to be used as a means of managing the consequences of a trustee\u2019s failure to proactively administer a bankrupt estate.\u00a0 This is to avoid the objections regime prejudicing the interests of cooperative bankrupts.\u00a0 For example, it would be inappropriate for the objections process to be used to elicit outstanding contribution payments from the bankrupt when there was no impediment to the trustee taking all necessary action at a much earlier stage.Income contributions when an objection has been filedIf the trustee files an objection to discharge and the bankrupt earns above the income threshold throughout the bankruptcy, the bankrupt will be liable to pay income contributions for the entire period of the extended bankruptcy.Example 6Sam becomes bankrupt by debtor\u2019s petition.\u00a0 Sam\u2019s trustee makes several requests for copies of pay slips and payment summaries.\u00a0 Sam fails to respond to these requests.\u00a0 The trustee files an objection to discharge, so Sam will be bankrupt for 8 years.The trustee calculates that Sam will be liable to pay about $20,000 in contributions for each year of his bankruptcy, which will be a total of $160,000 over 8 years.However, if Sam provides the requested information and the objection is withdrawn, he may only be bankrupt for 3 years (or until the date the objection is withdrawn, whichever is longer) and his income contributions over that time may be as low as $60,000.Grounds that were the basis of a previous objectionWhen setting out the ground(s) of objection, section 149C of the Bankruptcy Act requires that a trustee only include a ground(s) not previously cancelled by AFSA on review.\u00a0 This means that a ground(s) for objection based on the bankrupt\u2019s failure to comply with a duty under the Bankruptcy Act cannot be used if AFSA has already cancelled the same ground(s) during an earlier review.A trustee may file an objection on the same ground(s) where the bankrupt\u2019s failure to comply with duties under the Bankruptcy Act are based on different facts or a different situation.Example 7Riley\u2019s trustee filed an objection due to their failure to provide evidence of their income at the end of contribution assessment period (\u201cCAP\u201d) 1.\u00a0 This objection was later cancelled by AFSA on review.Riley\u2019s trustee is not prevented from filing an objection if Riley fails to provide evidence of their income for CAP2 and/or CAP3.Possible offencesTrustees who are filing a notice of objection should turn their mind to whether offences may have been committed by the bankrupt and take appropriate referral action.\u00a0 Some of the grounds of objection, particularly those relating to intentional failures by the bankrupt, may indicate that an offence has been committed.

            "IntroductionWhat is a debt agreement?Part IX of theBankruptcy Act 1966provides for a debtor putting a proposal to their creditors regarding repayment ofprovable debts, with creditors then voting whether to accept or reject the proposal.\u00a0 The proposal will specify the amount creditors will receive and the period over which the debtor will pay the total.The creditor voting process is conducted by the Official Receiver.[1]All creditors who are owed provable debts are then bound by the voting outcome.A debtor must appoint a registered debt agreement administrator or registered trustee to administer the agreement.[2]The registration requirements for administrators and trustees can be found inProcesses for registration of debt agreement administrators.The administrator manages the debt agreement, which includes monitoring compliance with the terms of the agreement by the debtor and paying dividends (distributions of money) to creditors.Scope of this practice documentThis practice document has been prepared to provide detailed information about the legislative and practice requirements of debt agreements for debtors, creditors and administrators.\u00a0 If you would like more general overview, you may wish to read the information onAFSA\u2019s website.EligibilityThere are certain eligibility criteria applying to debt agreements, which are outlined in this practice document.\u00a0 A debtor who is ineligible to propose a debt agreement may instead be able to become bankrupt or enter into a personal insolvency agreement, subject to certain other requirements.\u00a0 In a bankruptcy or personal insolvency agreement, the debtor\u2019s affairs will be investigated by a trustee.Lodgment feeWhen a debt agreement proposal is lodged with the Official Receiver, the debt agreement proposal lodgment fee (presently $200) is payable.Online lodgment of forms and other documents with the Official ReceiverTo lodge a debt agreement proposal, certain forms must be completed and submitted to the Official Receiver, who will ensure that the paperwork is complete and in order to be put to creditors for their vote.Debt agreement forms must be submitted electronically viadebt agreements onlineor AFSA\u2019sBusiness to Government channel.\n\nWhat is a debt agreement?\n\nPart IX of theBankruptcy Act 1966provides for a debtor putting a proposal to their creditors regarding repayment ofprovable debts, with creditors then voting whether to accept or reject the proposal.\u00a0 The proposal will specify the amount creditors will receive and the period over which the debtor will pay the total.\n\nThe creditor voting process is conducted by the Official Receiver.[1]\n\nAll creditors who are owed provable debts are then bound by the voting outcome.\n\nA debtor must appoint a registered debt agreement administrator or registered trustee to administer the agreement.[2]The registration requirements for administrators and trustees can be found inProcesses for registration of debt agreement administrators.\n\nThe administrator manages the debt agreement, which includes monitoring compliance with the terms of the agreement by the debtor and paying dividends (distributions of money) to creditors.\n\nScope of this practice document\n\nThis practice document has been prepared to provide detailed information about the legislative and practice requirements of debt agreements for debtors, creditors and administrators.\u00a0 If you would like more general overview, you may wish to read the information onAFSA\u2019s website.\n\nEligibility\n\nThere are certain eligibility criteria applying to debt agreements, which are outlined in this practice document.\u00a0 A debtor who is ineligible to propose a debt agreement may instead be able to become bankrupt or enter into a personal insolvency agreement, subject to certain other requirements.\u00a0 In a bankruptcy or personal insolvency agreement, the debtor\u2019s affairs will be investigated by a trustee.\n\nLodgment fee\n\nWhen a debt agreement proposal is lodged with the Official Receiver, the debt agreement proposal lodgment fee (presently $200) is payable.\n\n",

will ensure that the paperwork is complete and in order to be put to creditors for their vote.\n\nDebt agreement forms must be submitted electronically viadebt agreements onlineor AFSA\u2019sBusiness to Government channel.\n\nTypes of debts and their treatmentTerminologyAdebtoris any person who owes money.Aninsolvent debtoris a person who is unable to pay their debts as and when they fall due.Acreditoris a person to whom or entity to which money is owed.\u00a0 The money may be owed for various reasons, such as the repayment of a loan, a Court order requiring the debtor to pay damages for a car accident, outstanding school fees etc.Legislative treatment of debts in a debt agreementHow certain debts are treated in a debt agreement is outlined in various provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.\u00a0 This means that debtors, creditors, administrators and the Official Receiver do not have the power or discretion to determine which debts are provable in a debt agreement and which are not, nor which are extinguished and which are not.Secured / unsecuredAsecured debtis tied to specific property. \u00a0Examples include:a mortgage (where the house is security)a car loan (where the car is security)hire purchase or rent to buy (where items such as furniture or electronics are the security).For a debt agreement, a secured creditor means:in the case of a debt secured by aPersonal Property Securities Act 2009(\u201cPPS Act\u201d) security interest \u2013 the PPS Act secured party in relation to the interest, if the interest:i. arose as security for the debtii. is perfected (within the meaning of the PPS Act), orin the case of any other debt \u2013 a person holding a mortgage, charge or lien on property of the debtor as a security for a debt due.The secured creditor will have certain rights regarding taking possession of the property if the debt is not paid in accordance with the terms of the loan or agreement.Section 185XA of the Bankruptcy Act provides for the rights of a secured creditor not being affected by the lodgment of a debt agreement proposal or the making of a debt agreement.Anunsecured debtis a debt that is not tied to any property or right.\u00a0 This means that the creditor is not able to take possession of any property if the debtor does not make repayments.Whether a debt is secured or unsecured depends on the specific contract or agreement between the debtor and the creditor as at the time the debt was entered into.\u00a0 Although security interests in property other than real property will often be perfected by registration on the Personal Property Securities Register, there may be some security interests that are not registered or are not required to be registered in order to be perfected within the meaning of thePersonal Property Securities Act 2009.\u00a0 Similarly, there may be security interests attached to real property that are not recorded on title.\u00a0 Failure to register a security interest does not automatically mean that the debt is not secured.Where a debtor is not the registered owner of property but has an equitable interest in that property, consideration will need to be given to whether the security confers upon the creditor the means of satisfying the debt owed by the debtor.\u00a0 That is, it is possible for a debt to be secured where the debtor is not the registered owner (the legal owner) of the property.There are some debts that the law deems secured, such as water supply charges and rates/land charges in certain locations. \u00a0Some taxation debts may also become secured in certain circumstances.A shortfall (the difference between the amount owed to the creditor and the value of the property, as at the date a debt agreement proposal is accepted for processing and recorded on the National Personal Insolvency Index) is provable in a debt agreement, so this will need to be considered by the debtor and administrator when considering and preparing a debt agreement proposal.As the administrator is required to certify that, among other things, they are satisfied that the debtor will be able to discharge the obligations created by the agreement as and when they fall due, the administrator will need to have regard to the debtor\u2019s obligations to making continuing payments to secured creditors while the debt agreement is active, as this may impact the total debt agreement payments that the debtor can realistically make.\u00a0 The administrator must also consider the potential for the secured creditor to repossess the secured property during or after the debt agreement if the terms of the loan (including repayments) are not satisfied, as well as the effect this will have on the debtor.If a secured creditor realises its security while the agreement is in force, the (formerly secured) creditor is taken to be a creditor only to the extent of any outstanding provable debt.\u00a0 Any interest accrued on the debt after acceptance of the debt agreement proposal for processing cannot be recovered via the debt agreement.Example\u00a01Zane entered into a debt agreement in November 2020.\u00a0 At this time, he had a secured motor vehicle loan.\u00a0 The debt agreement is scheduled to be completed in November 2022.Zane stopped making his vehicle loan payments in May 2021.\u00a0 As a result, the creditor took possession of the vehicle in August 2021.\u00a0 At that time, the vehicle was sold for $10,000, which was applied to the loan.\u00a0 There was still $8000 owing.In Zane\u2019s debt agreement, the creditor is entitled to participate in dividends for the $8000 it is owed.\u00a0 All creditors\u2019 dividends are adjusted to ensure that they are paid the same dividend rate.\u00a0 As Zane is no longer paying his secured loan, he may be able to increase his debt agreement payments and finish his debt agreement before November 2022.Provable / non-provableAprovable debtis one that entitles the creditor to vote on a debt agreement proposal and to participate in dividends paid.\u00a0 Section 82 of the Bankruptcy Act outlines which debts are provable and sections 83 to 107 provide further detailed information about provable debts.A creditor with anon-provable debtis not entitled to vote on a debt agreement proposal and does not have an entitlement to participate in dividends (i.e. the creditor does not receive any payments from the debt agreement).\u00a0 The debtor will remain liable for non-provable debts both during the term of the debt agreement and after the debt agreement has ended.Extinguished / not extinguishedDebts that areextinguishedare those the debtor does not have a liability to pay after the terms of the debt agreement have been complied with and the debt agreement has been completed.\u00a0 Certain types of unsecured debts and shortfalls on secured debts that formed part of the debt agreement are extinguished when the debt agreement is completed \u2013 in effect, these debts end when the debt agreement is completed.\u00a0 If a debt agreement is not completed, for example if it is terminated, no debts are extinguished and the debtor is obliged to directly service whatever is remaining of the relevant debts.Debts that arenot extinguishedare those that the debtor will still have to pay both during the term of the debt agreement and after the debt agreement has ended.\u00a0 These debts include all non-provable debts, as well as some provable debts that the Bankruptcy Act specifically outlines as still being recoverable (such as child support debts).Debts that are provable and extinguished that relate to ongoing servicesThere are some debts that are provable and extinguished but, if not paid, will cause the loss of service as a consequence of non-payment.\u00a0 Examples include telephone, internet, pay television, school fees and motor vehicle registration.Disclosing all debts on the explanatory statement and certificationA debtor is required to disclose all of their liabilities on the debt agreement explanatory statement, irrespective of the particular categories into which the debts fall.Secured debts, such as mortgages and car loans, must be disclosed in Part C of the explanatory statement.Unsecured debts, such as credit cards, personal loans and unpaid bills, must be disclosed in Part D of the explanatory statement.Non-provable debts, such as unliquidated damages, must be disclosed in Part E of the explanatory statement.Contingent debts, where a liability to pay has not yet been called upon (such as a guarantee where the principal debtor has not defaulted so the guarantor isn\u2019t required to make any payments or transfer property), are to be disclosed in Part E of the explanatory statement.\u00a0 (Where the debts have crystallised, they will need to be disclosed in Part C or Part D.)An example of how the explanatory statement should be completed when there are secured debts is available atannexure A.More information about various categories of debtsMore information about the treatment of debts under the Bankruptcy Act is available inTreatment of debts in bankruptcy.\u00a0 Although written with a view to outlining how certain debts are treated in bankruptcy, the practice document has application to debt agreements as the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act in relation to provable debts apply equally.\n\n",

agreement proposal, they will be exempt from payment of the lodgment fee.\u00a0 Eligible disaster recovery payments are specified in clause 2.07 of the Bankruptcy (Fees and Remuneration) Determination.\u00a0 No other exemptions apply.The Bankruptcy Act and Bankruptcy Regulations make no provision for refund of the fee.Payment methodsPayment of the lodgment fee can be made

lodgment of the proposal with the Official Receiver.On account paymentsAdministrators may apply to have accounts with AFSA and to have fees invoiced on a regular basis.\u00a0 All accounts must be paid in full by their specified due dates.Any disputes regarding an invoice issued to an administrator will need to be raised with the Official Receiver, who will decide whether the dispute has merit.\u00a0 If it is found that it does have merit, the error or dispute will be resolved on a subsequent invoice via issuance of a credit.The lodgment fee on resubmission of a proposalWhere a debt agreement proposal is not accepted by the Official Receiver to send to creditors for their vote, a refund will not be provided. \u00a0A decision will be made whether the debtor will be permitted to

automatic that the proposal will be accepted \u2013 the same considerations applied to original proposal will be applied to the resubmitted proposal.Situations where a debtor may be permitted to resubmit the proposal without having to pay the fee again may include where the proposal is not accepted because of a minor defect in the documents lodged.\u00a0 Examples of minor defects include an inconsistency in personal details between the documents, an incomplete answer to a question or a calculation error in an expected end date, the date of first dividend, a budget item, fees, dividends or realisations charge.The debtor will not be permitted to resubmit their proposal without having to pay the fee again where:it was not accepted for a reason other than a minor defectthere are several clerical and/or calculation errors in the documentsthere are anomalies or inconsistencies relating to the signing and/or dating of the proposalthey have already resubmitted a proposal for no fee.Where acceptance of a debt agreement proposal (the first proposal) by creditors is conditional on the acceptance of another proposal (the second proposal) and the second proposal is not accepted by the Official Receiver to send to creditors, the first proposal may be resubmitted for no additional lodgment fee.\u00a0 Whether or not the second proposal can be submitted without payment of the fee will depend on the reason(s) for it not being accepted.Where it is determined that a proposal may be resubmitted for no additional lodgment fee, it must be resubmitted within 30 days of the date that the

charge.\n\nThe debtor will not be permitted to resubmit their proposal without having to pay the fee again where:it was not accepted for a reason other than a minor defectthere are several clerical and/or calculation errors in the documentsthere are anomalies or inconsistencies relating to the signing and/or dating of the proposalthey have already resubmitted a proposal for no fee.\n\nit was not accepted for a reason other than a minor defect\n\nthere are several clerical and/or calculation errors in the documents\n\nthere are anomalies or inconsistencies relating to the signing and/or dating of the proposal\n\nthey have already resubmitted a proposal for no fee.\n\nWhere acceptance of a debt agreement proposal (the first proposal) by creditors is conditional on the acceptance of another proposal (the second proposal) and the second proposal is not accepted by the Official Receiver to send to creditors, the first proposal may be resubmitted for no additional lodgment fee.\u00a0 Whether or not the second proposal can be submitted without payment of the fee will depend on the reason(s) for it not being accepted.\n\nWhere it is determined that a proposal may be resubmitted for no additional lodgment fee, it must be resubmitted within 30 days of the date that the Official Receiver advises that the original proposal has not been accepted.\n\nEligibility to make a debt agreementThe eligibility criteria in the Bankruptcy Act that apply to debt agreements are:the debtor must be insolvent (subsection 185C(1))the debtor must not have been subject to an administration under the Bankruptcy Act in the preceding 10 years (paragraph 185C(4)(a)), andthe debtor\u2019s unsecured debts, property and income must be below statutory thresholds (paragraphs 185C(4)(b), (c) and (d)).InsolvencyWhile the administrator is responsible for certifying the debtor\u2019s insolvency, the Official Receiver may seek clarification regarding certain factors that may indicate solvency, such as:the circumstances that led to the debtor becoming unable to pay their debts (for example, loss of employment)the status of unsecured debts (arrears, judgment etc.)the status of secured debts (for example, arrears, legal action having commenced, repossession etc.)the date the debtor was last able to pay their debts as and when they fell due, as advised by the debtor on their statement of affairswhether the debtor\u2019s income is sufficient to pay their debts.Any additional information supplied by the administrator or the debtor that supports a conclusion as to the debtor\u2019s insolvency is included as a comment in the Official Receiver\u2019s report that is sent to creditors.If sufficient evidence is not available to support the conclusion that the debtor is insolvent, the debt agreement proposal will not be accepted.Prior Bankruptcy Act proceedingsA debtor is ineligible to lodge a proposal where, in the preceding 10 years, they have:been bankruptbeen a party (as debtor) to a debt agreement, orsigned a controlling trustee authority.When a debt agreement proposal is presented to the Official Receiver, a check of the National Personal Insolvency Index (\u201cNPII\u201d) is conducted using the debtor\u2019s name, date of birth and any alias(es).\u00a0 (More information about the NPII is contained inpart 13of this document.)The relevant 10-year period in relation to an administration is as follows:in relation to a prior bankruptcy, the 10-year period runs from the date the bankruptcy endedfor a previous debt agreement, the 10-year period runs from:where all debt agreement obligations have been discharged, the date of completionwhere the debt agreement was terminated by creditors\u2019 resolution, the date of termination (section 185P of the Bankruptcy Act)where the debt agreement was terminated by the Official Receiver due to a designated 6-month arrears default, the date of termination (section 185QA of the Bankruptcy Act)where the debt agreement was terminated by the bankruptcy of the debtor (section 185R of the Bankruptcy Act), the 10-year period runs from the date the bankruptcy ends or endedfor a section 188 authority under Part X (the precursor to a personal insolvency agreement), the 10-year period runs from the date the authority was signed.If the debtor was bankrupt and that bankruptcy was annulled by the Court under section 153B of the Bankruptcy Act (which provides for annulment where the Court is satisfied that a sequestration order ought not to be made or a debtor\u2019s petition ought not to have been presented and accepted), that bankruptcy itself does not prevent the debtor from lodging a proposal.\u00a0 Likewise, a bankruptcy in a foreign jurisdiction does not prevent the debtor from lodging a proposal.If the debtor lodged a debt agreement proposal within the previous 10 years and that proposal was cancelled by the Official Receiver, the debtor has not been a party to a debt agreement and is entitled to lodge a new proposal if the other eligibility requirements are satisfied.Unsecured debts limitA debtor is ineligible to make a debt agreement if they have unsecured debts above a monetary limit.\u00a0 The limit is indexed in March and September each year and can be found on theindexed amounts page on AFSA\u2019s website.The total unsecured debts include any shortfall between a secured debt and the value of the security.Example\u00a02Ally owes a finance company $16,000 that is secured over a motor vehicle.\u00a0 The motor vehicle is presently worth $10,000.\u00a0 The finance company is an unsecured creditor in the amount of $6000, being the $16,000 owed less the $10,000 value of the secured property.Total unsecured debts are calculated at the time the debt agreement proposal is accepted for processing by the Official Receiver.The Official Receiverdoes nothave the discretion to accept a debt agreement proposal if the debtor\u2019s unsecured debts are above the limit, even if only by a small amount.Where there are inconsistencies in the information provided by the debtor on their proposal and explanatory statement, the Official Receiver may contact the administrator or debtor to ensure that the debtor has disclosed all unsecured debts owed and divisible property owned at the time of lodging the proposal.\u00a0 (More information about divisible property is containedbelow.)\u00a0 It is important to establish the amount of each debt at this time because, when statements of claim and voting are received from creditors, the amounts claimed are compared with the amounts disclosed by the debtor.The Official Receiver may seek clarification regarding a debtor\u2019s total unsecured debts and confirmation that:the debt details shown on the debt agreement proposal are consistent with those details on the explanatory statementall debts are disclosed on the debt agreement proposal and explanatory statement, including debts that are not provableany shortfall for a secured debt shown in respect of a secured creditor on the explanatory statement is disclosed as an unsecured debt.Where there is an inconsistency between the debt agreement proposal and the explanatory statement that may suggest a discrepancy such as an understatement or non-disclosure of a debt, a telephone call is made to the administrator and/or to the debtor.Value of the debtor\u2019s propertyA debtor is ineligible to make a debt agreement if they have net divisible property worth more than a monetary limit.\u00a0 The limit is indexed in March and September each year and can be found on theindexed amounts page on AFSA\u2019s website.Divisible property is property that, if the debtor became bankrupt, would be able to be sold by the bankruptcy trustee for the benefit of creditors.\u00a0 Divisible property does not include exempt or protected property.\u00a0 Net divisible property means the value of divisible property less amounts owed to secured creditors with valid claims.The Official Receiverdoes nothave the discretion to accept a debt agreement proposal if the value of the debtor\u2019s property is more than the limit, even if only by a small amount.The checks conducted regarding a debtor\u2019s divisible property may include:confirming that divisible property shown on the statement of affairs is adequately disclosed on the explanatory statementestablishing whether the property values disclosed appear to be reasonable and consistent with market values to ensure that property is disclosed at its true valuechecking whether the amount owed to a secured creditor may be overstated, which would mean that the net value of the secured property is understated.Where there is an inconsistency between the debt agreement proposal and the explanatory statement that may suggest a discrepancy, understatement or non-disclosure of property, a telephone call is made to the administrator and/or to the debtor.After tax income thresholdA debtor is ineligible to make a debt agreement if they have after tax income above a monetary limit.\u00a0 This limit is indexed in March and September each year and the current limit is available on theindexed amounts page on AFSA\u2019s website.\u00a0 The after tax income limit is three-quarters of the unsecured debt limit.After tax income is defined in subsection 185C(5) of the Bankruptcy Act to be the total income to be earned in the coming year (from the time the proposal is given to the Official Receiver) less income tax and the Medicare levy imposed on that income.\u00a0 It is important to note that these arethe only two deductionsthat are to be taken into account when assessing after tax income for these purposes.\u00a0 For instance, an amount the debtor pays for child support could not be included as a deduction when assessing after tax income.The Official Receiverdoes nothave the discretion to accept a debt agreement proposal if the debtor\u2019s after tax income is above the limit, even if only by a small amount.If the debtor earns business income, copies of current and projected income and expenditure statements, balance sheets and statements of business assets are expected to be held by the administrator and may be accessed by the Official Receiver to confirm the debtor\u2019s eligibility or to clarify aspects of the proposal for creditors.The checks conducted to ensure all sources of income are disclosed include:confirming that the income shown on the explanatory statement does not exceed the limitverifying that the income and occupation shown on the explanatory statement are consistent with information on the debtor\u2019s statement of affairsensuring that income is not understated to make it appear that the debtor is eligible to make a debt agreement, when in fact they are ineligibleensuring that the income disclosed includes allowances, benefits, lump sum payments and other amounts that would normally be expected to be paid to a person in that occupationreviewing the inclusion of interest, dividends and rent from assets after deducting the expenses of earning that incomereviewing the inclusion of income from any business(es) owned by the debtor after deducting all expenses directly attributable to that businessensuring that income is not understated to disguise from creditors the debtor\u2019s true ability to pay their debts.Where significant unexplained differences are apparent between past and expected income and/or where the debtor discloses income inconsistent with their occupation, a telephone call is made to the administrator and/or to the debtor to obtain clarification and information.Payment to income ratioParagraph 185C(4)(e) of the Bankruptcy Act refers to a formula for calculating the ratio of the debtor\u2019s payments under a debt agreement proposal to income, with reference made to a percentage determined by an instrument signed by the Minister.At this time, there isn\u2019t an instrument specifying the percentage, and so the payment to income ratio is not presently a debt agreement eligibility consideration.\n\n",

agreement proposal for processingWhere the Official Receiver is satisfied that the debtor is eligible to propose a debt agreement and that the debt agreement proposal lodgment fee has been paid, the Official Receiver must then be satisfied that the proposal complies with other legislative requirements before it can be accepted to send to creditors for voting.Approved formsSubsection 185C(2) of the Bankruptcy Act requires that the proposal be in the approved form and subsection 185C(2B) requires that an explanatory statement in the approved form accompany the proposal.The administrator must submit one of two certificates, with the relevant certificate depending on the circumstances of the proposal.\u00a0 More detailed information about the certificate is containedbelow.The approved proposal form, explanatory statement, statement of affairs and certificate are available viadebt agreements online.Undue hardshipThe Official Receiver can refuse to accept a debt agreement proposal for processing if the Official Receiver reasonably believes that complying with the debt agreement would cause undue hardship to the debtor (see subsection 185E(2AB) of the Bankruptcy Act).Prior to the legislative changes in 2019, an administrator was already required to certify that the debtor was likely to be able to discharge the obligations created by the agreement as and when those obligations fall due.\u00a0 This certification will already prevent most agreements that would cause the debtor undue hardship.\u00a0 Accordingly, it would only be in exceptional circumstances that the Official Receiver would be called upon to consider whether to exercise this discretion not to send the debt agreement proposal to affected creditors for voting.The term undue hardship is defined in section 111 of the Bankruptcy Regulations, which relates to requests to the Inspector-General for waiver or remission of charges, as follows:\u201c\u2026undue hardshipmeans hardship that is unusual and exceptional in comparison to the hardship arising in the normal course of bankruptcy.\u201dWhile this definition existed prior to the legislative changes in 2019 and it does not specifically reference debt agreements, the Official Receiver will consider in an undue hardship assessment whether the debtor is suffering or will suffer hardship beyond what would be experienced by any other person who seeks the protection of the Bankruptcy Act.While the Courts have not yet had the opportunity to consider the application of the Official Receiver\u2019s power to reject a debt agreement proposal due to undue hardship, some principles established in case law regarding other matters include that the term does not lend itself to precise quantification and it is necessary to make an objective evaluation of the personal, family and financial circumstances of the debtor.\u00a0 This means that, because of each individual debtor\u2019s unique circumstances (such as total debts, total amount offered under the debt agreement proposal, accommodation status \u2013 renting, buying or otherwise \u2013 and cost of that accommodation, income, number of dependants etc.), an exact quantitative measure cannot be put in place in order to determine whether a debtor will suffer undue hardship.The Official Receiver will reference the information provided in the debtor\u2019s explanatory statement and make an assessment of whether the terms of the debt agreement proposal would result in the debtor being unable to service their and any dependants\u2019 non-discretionary expenses, being the costs of:accommodationfoodmedical treatmenteducationbasic utilities (water, electricity and gas).In circumstances where the Official Receiver has taken all factors apparent from the proposal into consideration and believes that compliance with the proposed agreement would cause the debtor undue hardship, attempts will be made to undertake reasonable enquiries with debtor and/or the administrator prior to making a decision.The power for the Official Receiver to refuse to accept a proposal for processing for undue hardship will also apply to a proposal to vary a debt agreement.In the case of both debt agreement proposals and variations, the power is discretionary and will not require the Official Receiver to review every lodgment.Duration of the agreementThere are maximum durations for debt agreements:if the debtor has an interest in their principal place of residence[3]and they are not undertaking to sell that property for the duration of the proposed debt agreement, the proposal may provide for a maximum of a5-yeardebt agreement.\u00a0 The 5-year period starts from the day the debt agreement is madea debtor who does not have an interest in their principal place of residence may lodge a proposal that provides for a maximum of a3-yeardebt agreement.\u00a0 The 3-year period starts from the day the debt agreement is made.Signing and dating the forms and lodging within 14 daysThe proposal must be lodged within 14 days of the debtor signing and dating the proposal and associated documents to ensure that the information for creditors is current and that it accurately discloses the debtor\u2019s current circumstances.In cases where there is doubt about whether the debtor has signed a complete document or has signed a changed document, a telephone call to the debtor is made to confirm whether or not the debtor signed the complete document that was lodged and is aware of all the information in the document.It is essential for the debtor to view all completed pages before signing the documents to ensure that accurate information is provided to creditors and because the debtor may commit an offence if they provide false or misleading information.The signature may be electronic or a scanned copy of an originally signed document.\u00a0 Either way, the signature should appear on the documents as it appears on the debtor\u2019s identification documents.\u00a0 The administrator is required to retain a copy of the signed document, regardless of the method of signing.Certificate from the administratorThe administrator, when consenting to act, is required to provide a certificate to the Official Receiver.\u00a0 Where the proposal is accepted for sending to creditors for their vote, the certificate is also sent to creditors.There are two certificates, with the applicable certificate depending on the circumstances of the proposal:where the amount offered under the proposal and the debtor\u2019s income do not exceed the payment to income ratio, certificate 1 is to be usedwhere the amount offered under the proposal and the debtor\u2019s income do exceed the payment to income ratio, certificate 2 is to be used.\u00a0 This will require the administrator to certify that they are satisfied that the debtor can maintain the payments under the debt agreement proposal.Both certificates provide for the following:confirmation that the administrator consents to act as the administrator of the debt agreementthat the administrator has given the debtor a copy of the prescribed information, which summarises the options available to manage debts and the consequencesthat the administrator has reasonable grounds to believe that the debtor is likely to be able to make the payments offered in the debt agreementthat all information required to be set out in the debtor\u2019s statement of affairs, debt agreement proposal and explanatory statement have been set out, andthat the administrator has reasonable grounds to believe that the debtor has fully disclosed the information required to be disclosed on the forms.The certificate from the administrator must also disclose the details of any broker or referrer relationships, including any payments made for any referrals.\u00a0 In addition, the certificate must declare whether the proposed administrator is also an affected creditor and whether any other affected creditors are also related entities of the administrator.Where the proposal exceeds the prescribed payment to income ratio, the administrator may certify that the payments are viable despite this.\u00a0 The administrator may certify that they are satisfied that the debtor is likely to be able to make the payments offered in the agreement.The obligation to certify that the administrator has reasonable grounds to believe that all the information required to be set out in a debtor\u2019s statement of affairs and explanatory statement has been set out in those documents extends to ensuring that secured creditors are disclosed and the values of secured property and secured debts are accurately stated.\u00a0 The administrator should not rely on the debtor\u2019s opinion as to the market value of secured property and, instead, is expected to obtain corroboration from an independent source.\u00a0 What is appropriate corroboration will depend upon the nature of the asset and the circumstances of the case and may include online reviews of the prices of similar properties listed for sale, an online appraisal of the value of a vehicle or the administrator\u2019s own personal knowledge.\u00a0 A formal valuation is not necessarily required.More details about certification can be found inDebt agreement administrators\u2019 guidelines to certification requirements.Proposal only provides for transfer of money to creditorsA debt agreement proposal must not provide for the transfer of any property other than money to creditors (subsection 185C(2A) of the Bankruptcy Act).Where the proposal is not in the interests of creditorsThe Official Receiver must not accept a debt agreement proposal to send to creditors for voting where creditors\u2019 interests would be better served by the proposal not being accepted for processing (subsection 185E(3) of the Bankruptcy Act).\u00a0 In exercising this discretion, the Official Receiver is not making a decision about whether the debt agreement would be in the interests of creditors; rather, the discretion merely ensures that creditors are able to vote on an informed basis.Although it is not possible to be definitive as to the circumstances when the Official Receiver would exercise this discretion, examples of where it may be exercised are where:a debtor\u2019s affairs are so complex that they result in a lack of clarity for creditors.\u00a0 In such a situation, consideration is given to whether creditors\u2019 interests are better served by not sending a proposal for their vote.Bankruptcy or a personal insolvency agreementmay be a better option to enable the debtor\u2019s affairs to be fully investigatedthe proposal is not likely to be understood by creditors.\u00a0 In this situation, before rejecting a proposal the Official Receiver will make a telephone call to determine if the proposal is capable of being understood by creditors with the addition of a comment in the Official Receiver\u2019s report to creditorsinformation is available or becomes available to suggest that the debtor has income, property and/or liabilities that have not been disclosed in the proposal.The power for the Official Receiver to refuse to accept a proposal for processing where creditors\u2019 interests would be better served by not accepting the proposal also applies to proposals to vary a debt agreement. \u00a0This discretion may be exercised in relation to variation proposals where the proposal seeks to extend the length of the agreement beyond 3 years and there is insufficient or incomplete information to support the grounds for extension.Where the debtor has only one creditorThe debt agreement system is not generally meant for a debtor who has only one creditor because they are able to negotiate with the creditor or access the creditor\u2019s hardship provisions.\u00a0 In most cases, it is not appropriate to ask a single participating creditor to vote on something that is essentially an agreement that should be reached directly with the debtor.Where a debt agreement proposal involving a single creditor is lodged, it will not be accepted for processing unless the debtor is able to establish that there are exceptional circumstances that would justify accepting it.\u00a0 Some examples of what may constitute exceptional circumstances are where:a debtor has only one creditor, and their partner is also proposing a debt agreement and has multiple creditors.\u00a0 This may be considered exceptional as it may be the only way that the debtors are able to manage their joint financial affairsthe single creditor has advised the administrator that they are interested in reviewing the debt agreement proposal and participating in the voting process.As subsection 185E(3) of the Bankruptcy Act does not permit the Official Receiver to accept a proposal when the interests of creditors will be better served by them not accepting the proposal, where a single creditor proposal is received the Official Receiver will notify that creditor and advise that it is proposed to not accept the proposal.\u00a0 The Official Receiver will allow the creditor 2 business days to respond.Person authorised to deal with propertyWhere a debt agreement proposal authorises a person to sell or deal with property, the proposal will not be accepted unless the person is a registered administrator or trustee, or unless the Official Receiver is satisfied that the person passes the basic eligibility test.Resubmitted proposalsMajor creditors have indicated that they are unwilling to vote for the same proposal on resubmission unless there is an additional benefit to them or the creditors have indicated that they are prepared to reconsider the proposal in its original form.The resubmitted proposal is compared to the previous proposal(s) to understand the extent to which the original proposal has changed and any different benefit to the creditors.\u00a0 The resubmitted proposal will only be accepted and sent for voting if:there is an increase in the estimated dividend to creditors or another benefit to them, and/orthe creditors have stated that they will reconsider the proposal in the same form.A fresh eligibility check is performed when a proposal is resubmitted, which involves the same checks applied to the initial proposal, for example that the administrator is still eligible, the thresholds are not exceeded etc.A resubmitted proposal will not be accepted if:there is an issue that has not been addressed from a previous proposal unless the matter is clarified in a telephone call made to the debtor or proposed administrator, and/orit is a straightforward resubmission without a change or a statement on the explanatory statement that creditors have agreed to reconsider and accept the proposal.Review of decision to not accept a proposalThe debtor may apply to the Administrative Review Tribunal for a review of the Official Receiver\u2019s decision to not accept a debt agreement proposal for processing.\n\n",
            "Where the Official Receiver is satisfied that the debtor is eligible to propose a debt agreement and that the debt agreement proposal lodgment fee has been paid, the Official Receiver must then be satisfied that the proposal complies with other legislative requirements before it can be accepted to send to creditors for voting.\n\nApproved forms\n\nSubsection 185C(2) of the Bankruptcy Act requires that the proposal be in the approved form and subsection 185C(2B) requires that an explanatory statement in the approved form accompany the proposal.\n\nThe administrator must submit one of two certificates, with the relevant certificate depending on the circumstances of the proposal.\u00a0 More detailed information about the certificate is containedbelow.\n\nThe approved proposal form, explanatory statement, statement of affairs and certificate are available viadebt agreements online.\n\nUndue hardship\n\nThe Official Receiver can refuse to accept a debt agreement proposal for processing if the Official Receiver reasonably believes that complying with the debt agreement would cause undue hardship to the debtor (see subsection 185E(2AB) of the Bankruptcy Act).\n\nPrior to the legislative changes in 2019, an administrator was already required to certify that the debtor was likely to be able to discharge the obligations created by the agreement as and when those obligations fall due.\u00a0 This certification will already prevent most agreements that would cause the debtor undue hardship.\u00a0 Accordingly, it would only be in exceptional circumstances that the Official Receiver would be called upon to consider whether to exercise this discretion not to send the debt agreement proposal to affected creditors for voting.\n\nThe term undue hardship is defined in section 111 of the Bankruptcy Regulations, which relates to requests to the Inspector-General for waiver or remission of charges, as follows:\u201c\u2026undue hardshipmeans hardship that is unusual and exceptional in comparison to the hardship arising in the normal course of bankruptcy.\u201dWhile this definition existed prior to the legislative changes in 2019 and it does not specifically reference debt agreements, the Official Receiver will consider in an undue hardship assessment whether the debtor is suffering or will suffer hardship beyond what would be experienced by any other person who seeks the protection of the Bankruptcy Act.\n\n\u201c\u2026undue hardshipmeans hardship that is unusual and exceptional in comparison to the hardship arising in the normal course of bankruptcy.\u201d\n\nWhile this definition existed prior to the legislative changes in 2019 and it does not specifically reference debt agreements, the Official Receiver will consider in an undue hardship assessment whether the debtor is suffering or will suffer hardship beyond what would be experienced by any other person who seeks the protection of the Bankruptcy Act.\n\nWhile the Courts have not yet had the opportunity to consider the application of the Official Receiver\u2019s power to reject a debt agreement proposal due to undue hardship, some principles established in case law regarding other matters include that the term does not lend itself to precise quantification and it is necessary to make an objective evaluation of the personal, family and financial circumstances of the debtor.\u00a0 This means that, because of each individual debtor\u2019s unique circumstances (such as total debts, total amount offered under the debt agreement proposal, accommodation status \u2013 renting, buying or otherwise \u2013 and cost of that accommodation, income, number of dependants etc.), an exact quantitative measure cannot be put in place in order to determine whether a debtor will suffer undue hardship.\n\nThe Official Receiver will reference the information provided in the debtor\u2019s explanatory statement and make an assessment of whether the terms of the debt agreement proposal would result in the debtor being unable to service their and any dependants\u2019 non-discretionary expenses, being the costs of:accommodationfoodmedical treatmenteducationbasic utilities (water, electricity and gas).\n\n",
            "accommodation\n\nfood\n\nmedical treatment\n\neducation\n\nbasic utilities (water, electricity and gas).\n\nIn circumstances where the Official Receiver has taken all factors apparent from the proposal into consideration and believes that compliance with the proposed agreement would cause the debtor undue hardship, attempts will be made to undertake reasonable enquiries with debtor and/or the administrator prior to making a decision.\n\nThe power for the Official Receiver to refuse to accept a proposal for processing for undue hardship will also apply to a proposal to vary a debt agreement.\n\nIn the case of both debt agreement proposals and variations, the power is discretionary and will not require the Official Receiver to review every lodgment.\n\nDuration of the agreement\n\nThere are maximum durations for debt agreements:if the debtor has an interest in their principal place of residence[3]and they are not undertaking to sell that property for the duration of the proposed debt agreement, the proposal may provide for a maximum of a5-yeardebt agreement.\u00a0 The 5-year period starts from the day the debt agreement is madea debtor who does not have an interest in their principal place of residence may lodge a proposal that provides for a maximum of a3-yeardebt agreement.\u00a0 The 3-year period starts from the day the debt agreement is made.\n\nif the debtor has an interest in their principal place of residence[3]and they are not undertaking to sell that property for the duration of the proposed debt agreement, the proposal may provide for a maximum of a5-yeardebt agreement.\u00a0 The 5-year period starts from the day the debt agreement is made\n\na debtor who does not have an interest in their principal place of residence may lodge a proposal that provides for a maximum of a3-yeardebt agreement.\u00a0 The 3-year period starts from the day the debt agreement is made.\n\nSigning and dating the forms and lodging within 14 days\n\nThe proposal must be lodged within 14 days of the debtor signing and dating the proposal and associated documents to ensure that the information for creditors is current and that it accurately discloses the debtor\u2019s current circumstances.\n\nIn cases where there is doubt about whether the debtor has signed a complete document or has signed a changed document, a telephone call to the debtor is made to confirm whether or not the debtor signed the complete document that was lodged and is aware of all the information in the document.\n\nIt is essential for the debtor to view all completed pages before signing the documents to ensure that accurate information is provided to creditors and because the debtor may commit an offence if they provide false or misleading information.\n\nThe signature may be electronic or a scanned copy of an originally signed document.\u00a0 Either way, the signature should appear on the documents as it appears on the debtor\u2019s identification documents.\u00a0 The administrator is required to retain a copy of the signed document, regardless of the method of signing.\n\nCertificate from the administrator\n\nThe administrator, when consenting to act, is required to provide a certificate to the Official Receiver.\u00a0 Where the proposal is accepted for sending to creditors for their vote, the certificate is also sent to creditors.\n\nThere are two certificates, with the applicable certificate depending on the circumstances of the proposal:where the amount offered under the proposal and the debtor\u2019s income do not exceed the payment to income ratio, certificate 1 is to be usedwhere the amount offered under the proposal and the debtor\u2019s income do exceed the payment to income ratio, certificate 2 is to be used.\u00a0 This will require the administrator to certify that they are satisfied that the debtor can maintain the payments under the debt agreement proposal.\n\nwhere the amount offered under the proposal and the debtor\u2019s income do not exceed the payment to income ratio, certificate 1 is to be used\n\nwhere the amount offered under the proposal and the debtor\u2019s income do exceed the payment to income ratio, certificate 2 is to be used.\u00a0 This will require the administrator to certify that they are satisfied that the debtor can maintain the payments under the debt agreement proposal.\n\n",

unsecured creditor:the proposalthe explanatory statementa reportdetails about lodging a claim and vote form (\u201cCAV\u201d) online.The right of a creditor to vote and the amount for which they may vote is initially based on the documents provided by the debtor and may be reviewed when the completed CAV is returned by the creditor.\u00a0 It is the Official Receiver\u2019s responsibility to assess a creditor\u2019s eligibility to vote on the proposal.Each creditor may vote \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d or may abstain.\u00a0 By lodging a completed CAV, the creditor can provide details of their claim for dividend purposes.In order to validly vote, the CAV must be completed and returned by the voting deadline date to establish all the following information:whether the party is in fact a creditorthe amount of unsecured debtin relation to a secured debt, the value of the security and the net amount (i.e. the unsecured portion) owedwhether the creditor is a related entity and, if so, the amount of the purchase price of the debtwhether the creditor voted yes or no or abstained.The creditor is given the option to provide a reason as to why they voted in a certain way.\u00a0 The creditor is also given the option to have this reason disclosed to the administrator.The voting deadline date is provided for in section 185 of the Bankruptcy Act and is 35 days after the date on which the Official Receiver accepted the proposal to send to creditors for voting or 42 days in December.A CAV received after the end of the deadline date cannot be accepted.Eligibility to vote and amount for which the creditor may voteTo be eligible to vote, a creditor must have a provable debt \u2013 either an unsecured debt or an estimated shortfall on a secured debt \u2013 at the time the acceptance of the debt agreement proposal was recorded on the NPII.\u00a0 Interest is calculated to this date and must be rebated if the contract provides for lump sum interest over the life of the loan.For debt agreement proposals lodged on or after 27 June 2019, the Official Receiver must not request a vote from a proposed administrator that is also an affected creditor or from a related entity of the proposed administrator.\u00a0 This also applies to proposals to vary or terminate a debt agreement, where the original debt agreement proposal was given to the Official Receiver on or after 27 June 2019 (but not to a variation or termination proposal given to the Official Receiver before this date).Where a party who submits a CAV appears to be claiming an assigned debt, it is for the Official Receiver to determine whether they are an affected creditor who is entitled to participate in the debt agreement and voting process.\u00a0 The Official Receiver will verify that an assignment has occurred and will decide the value of the vote based on the information provided by:the debtor on their explanatory statement and statement of affairsthe creditor on their CAVcontacting the administrator, including referencing documents held by the administratorcontacting the debtor and/or creditor.The amount claimed by a creditor may vary from the amount disclosed by the debtor.\u00a0 Where there is a difference and it is material, a telephone call is made to the creditor and/or debtor to assist in deciding the amount of the creditor\u2019s vote.Where a debt has been assigned to a related entity of the debtor, as defined in section 5 of the Bankruptcy Act, that entity may only vote for the amount that was paid for the assignment of the debt.If the debtor or administrator disputes the eligibility of a creditor to vote on the debt agreement proposal, this will need to be brought to the attention of the Official Receiver for consideration during the voting period.The Bankruptcy Act makes it an offence for an administrator to give, agree to give or offer to give an affected creditor an incentive for voting a certain way on a debt agreement proposal or on a variation or termination proposal.Secured creditorsA secured creditor is entitled to vote for the shortfall after deducting the value of security or for any actual shortfall after repossession and sale.Example 3Ally owes a finance company $16,000 that is secured over a motor vehicle.\u00a0 The motor vehicle is presently worth $10,000.\u00a0 The finance company is entitled to vote on the proposal in the amount of $6000.If there is doubt as to whether the value given to the security reflects the market value after taking into account expenses of repossession and sale, the Official Receiver may request further information.Any decision by the Official Receiver as to the amount for which a secured creditor is permitted to vote is not binding on the administrator when the administrator assesses the secured creditor\u2019s entitlement to participate in dividends.Subsection 185C(2) of the Bankruptcy Act also provides that creditors are not entitled to receive more than the amount of their provable debt.\u00a0 This may require amendments to the value of securities.\u00a0 Administrators must ensure that, where secured creditors are still receiving payments from the debtor, payments are not made to secured creditors with respect to the unsecured portion of their claims if the claims of the secured creditor have been satisfied in full.Example\u00a04When Wendell lodged his debt agreement proposal, he had a secured car loan with $20,000 owing.\u00a0 Wendell and the creditor believed the car to be worth $11,000. The creditor was permitted to vote on the debt agreement in the amount of $9000. Following increases in the price of second hand vehicles, the creditor believes during the debt agreement that the vehicle is now worth $14,000.\u00a0 As such, the creditor is only entitled to participate in dividends for the $6000 shortfall. If the creditor had already received $6000 in dividends from the debt agreement, it would not be entitled to receive further dividends.A secured creditor can choose not to accept debt agreement dividends and, instead, rely on direct payments made by the debtor.\u00a0 A secured creditor is in a different position to unsecured creditors in this regard, and the secured creditor could choose to only assert its right to participate in dividends in the debt agreement if the debtor defaults and the secured creditor subsequently repossesses its security and suffers a shortfall.\u00a0 Irrespective of what a secured creditor choses to do in relation to dividends, it will still be a party to the debt agreement and the debtor will still be required to disclose details of the secured creditor on their debt agreement forms.\u00a0 The secured creditor will still be bound by the debt agreement and the debt will be extinguished upon completion of the debt agreement, except in respect of the rights to deal with the security (i.e. a secured creditor can realise its security after the completion of a debt agreement, although it won\u2019t be able to pursue the debtor for any shortfall).If it is anticipated that a secured creditor will not be accepting dividend payments, this should be disclosed by the debtor on their debt agreement forms.Where an undisclosed creditor(s) become known during the voting stageIf a creditor who lodges a CAV was not disclosed on the debt agreement proposal, a telephone call is made to the creditor and/or debtor to assist in deciding whether the creditor has a provable debt and the value for which they may vote.Where the unsecured debt of an undisclosed creditor is material or there is a material difference in the amount claimed compared to the amount disclosed by the debtor (for example, where the amount may materially reduce the estimated dividend), the proposal will be cancelled.Changing a voteTo change their vote, the creditor can lodge a fresh CAV prior to the deadline date.Determining the resultWhen a CAV passes all compliance checks, the vote is recorded and is verified the day after the deadline.The vote result is based on a majority in value of the unsecured debts of creditors who are eligible to vote and who lodge a valid vote on a CAV, excluding any votes from the administrator and/or related entities.Information on the progress of voting is not provided to any party.\u00a0 However, the debtor or an affected creditor may apply to the Official Receiver to make arrangements to inspect, or obtain a copy or extract of, a CAV.The debtor, creditors and administrator are notified of the voting outcome.The voting result is recorded on the NPII as a debt agreement or rejection of the proposal.\n\n",

debt agreement generally arises from a change in the debtor\u2019s circumstances, for example:a change in income resulting in a reduction or increase in the amount they can affordan increase in the number of dependants, such as an additional childthe loss of a partner\u2019s incomean increase in household expensesa loss on repossession of secured property during the debt agreement resulting in an increased value of provable debtsan increase in income from a new job resulting in an ability to increase in paymentssupport from a third party to assist with paymentsthe ability of the debtor to offer a lump sum to complete the agreement.Only a debtor or, in limited circumstances, an affected creditor may lodge a proposal to vary a debt agreement.\u00a0 An administrator may only lodge a proposal to vary if they are also an affected creditor.A variation proposal must be accompanied by a certificate signed by the administrator stating that the debtor is likely to be able to discharge the obligations created by the agreement (as proposed in the variation) as and when they fall due.The proposal to vary, accompanying explanatory statement and certificate must be submitted electronically viadebt agreements onlineor AFSA\u2019sBusiness to Government channel.The difference between the original agreement or a later variation (if applicable) and the variation being proposed must be sufficiently clear to ensure that creditors are well informed when they vote.If the difference or the variation is unclear, a telephone call is made to the debtor and/or administrator.\u00a0 If additional information or an explanation would clarify the position for creditors, the variation proposal will be returned to the submitting party to amend.\u00a0 Alternatively, the variation proposal may be rejected by creditors on the basis of there being a lack of clarity and/or it not being in the interests of creditors.The Official Receiver will examine the explanatory statement accompanying the variation proposal to ensure that the changes to the debtor\u2019s circumstances are fully disclosed and are consistent with the proposal to vary the debtor\u2019s payments.\u00a0 The explanatory statement should include details of positive and negative changes to the debtor\u2019s circumstances.\u00a0 This ensures that, where there are multiple changes, these can all be considered by creditors.\u00a0 Where there is an inconsistency, a telephone call is made to the debtor.Variation proposed by a creditorThere are a limited number of instances where a creditor may propose a variation that does not affect the payments and obligations of the debtor (for example, proposing to change the administrator \u2013 seebelow).Where a creditor has proposed a variation relating to payments made or actions undertaken by the debtor, it is not practical for this to be accepted for processing unless the creditor can establish that there has been negotiation with the debtor to ensure that the debtor will be able to complete the varied agreement.\u00a0 This means that a variation proposal that is lodged by a creditor relating to payment or action by the debtor without documented agreement by the debtor will not be accepted to send to creditors for voting.Telephone calls are made to the debtor and administrator to establish whether agreement has been obtained.\u00a0 A telephone call is made to the creditor explaining the practicalities of proposing such a variation without agreement by the debtor.\u00a0 An alternative is for the creditor to persuade the debtor to lodge their own variation proposal.Variation to change the administratorA proposal to change the administrator must be accompanied by a consent to the appointment signed by the proposed administrator.\u00a0 The proposal will not be accepted unless the proposed administrator is a registered administrator or registered trustee.Accepting a variation proposal for processingIf a proposal to vary has already been rejected by creditors, a further proposal to vary in the same terms will not be accepted unless creditors have indicated that they will reconsider this variation.\u00a0 If a fresh proposal provides for a material benefit to creditors, it is sent for voting.If completion of the debt agreement occurs before the proposal to vary voting deadline, the debt agreement is completed.If a 6-month arrears default occurs before the voting deadline date for the proposal to vary, the debt agreement is terminated.It is not a valid reason to extend the length of the debt agreement if the debtor simply finds the debt agreement payments to be unaffordable without any change to their circumstances (i.e. where the agreement was unaffordable to begin with).Where a debt agreement proposal was given to the Official Receiver on or after 27 June 2019, a proposal to vary it cannot have the effect of extending the timeframe for making payments under the agreement beyond 3 years from the original agreement date, or 5 years in the following circumstances:If the debtor was exempt from the 3-year limit at the original proposal time because they had an interest in their principal place of residence, they are still exempt from this when proposing to vary their debt agreement.\u00a0 The agreement may therefore last up to 5 years from the original agreement date.The debtor may seek to extend the length of the agreement to up to 5 years from the original agreement date if they have suffered a substantial change in circumstances after the debt agreement was made, that was unforeseen at the time and makes them unlikely to be able to discharge their obligations.\u00a0 The debtor is required to provide details of the change in circumstances in the proposal to vary the agreement.\u00a0 The administrator is required to certify that the debtor meets the conditions to extend the length of their agreement for this reason.\u00a0 In this case, a variation cannot seek to extend the length of the debt agreement and also increase the total payment amount to be made by the debtor.The Official Receiver may reject a proposal to vary a debt agreement if the Official Receiver reasonably believes that the agreement as proposed to be varied would cause undue hardship to the debtor. \u00a0This is applicable only to proposals to vary agreements where the original debt agreement proposal was given to the Official Receiver on or after 27 June 2019. \u00a0For considerations regarding the Official Receiver\u2019s power to reject a proposal to vary for this reason, seeabove.Example\u00a05Edwin lodged a debt agreement proposal a year ago, in which he undertook to pay $500 per week to his creditors.\u00a0 He later lost his job and submitted a variation, offering creditors $75 per week from his social security benefits. With reference to themaximum basic rates of pension, it would be difficult to conclude that the $75 per week offered by Edwin in his varied agreement would not have a significant impact on his ability to meet his other non-discretionary expenses.The Official Receiver may reject a proposal to vary a debt agreement if the Official Receiver thinks that creditors\u2019 interests would be better served by not accepting the variation proposal for processing.\u00a0 This is applicable only to proposals to vary agreements where the original debt agreement proposal was given to the Official Receiver on or after 27 June 2019.\u00a0 In exercising this discretion, the Official Receiver is not making a decision about whether the proposal to vary the agreement would be in the interests of creditors; rather, the discretion merely ensures that creditors are able to vote on an informed basis.\u00a0 The Official Receiver may exercise this discretion if insufficient or incomplete information has been provided to support extending the length of the debt agreement.Review of a decision to not accept a variation proposal for processingThe debtor may apply to the Administrative Review Tribunal for a review of the Official Receiver\u2019s decision to not accept a variation proposal for processing.Voting periodThe voting deadline date is 35 days after the date on which the Official Receiver accepted the variation proposal to send to creditors for voting or 42 days in December.Proposal to terminate a debt agreementA debtor or creditor may propose termination of a debt agreement.\u00a0 The following are examples of the types of situations that may prompt a proposal to terminate:the failure of the debtor to start or maintain payments with little likelihood of completing the debt agreementa change to the debtor\u2019s circumstances where they can no longer afford payments and a variation to reduce payments is not feasiblematerial non-disclosure of employment or income that would have affected the creditors\u2019 original decision to support a debt agreementa material reduction in the estimated dividend to creditors because of significant undisclosed debta material omission of divisible property that would have affected the creditors\u2019 original decision to accept the debt agreement.Only a debtor or a creditor who is a party to the debt agreement may lodge a proposal to terminate a debt agreement.\u00a0 An administrator may only lodge a proposal to terminate when they are an affected creditor.The proposal to terminate and accompanying explanatory statement must be submitted electronically viadebt agreements onlineor AFSA\u2019sBusiness to Government channel.While the reasons for proposing termination are not prescribed, a proposal to terminate would generally only be appropriate where the debtor has failed to perform the terms of the debt agreement or failed to disclose material information that affected creditors\u2019 original vote.A creditor lodging a proposal to terminate must obtain and lodge with the proposal a status report from the administrator showing whether the payments are up to date, the amount of arrears and the likelihood of the debtor continuing payments to complete the debt agreement.A proposal to terminate without a current status report will not be sent for a vote until the creditors can be given an up-to-date report on the agreement.The practice of obtaining a status report with a proposal to terminate is aimed at ensuring that agreements that are up to date are not terminated.\u00a0 Creditors must be kept informed by the administrator if an agreement is in arrears and should communicate with the administrator to ensure they are adequately informed before considering a termination.If a proposal to terminate is lodged by a creditor when payments by the debtor are up to date and no other reason is provided for the proposal on the form, it will not be processed.\u00a0 This means that a reason(s) must be provided in the explanatory statement section of the form, such as non-disclosure of income, debts or property that materially affect the dividend rate to creditors.\u00a0 Creditors not having received dividends from the debt agreement may not be a valid reason because payment of a dividend is the responsibility of the administrator.\u00a0 Where there is no valid reason provided, a telephone call is made to the debtor, administrator or creditor to clarify the reason prompting the proposal to enable the Official Receiver to report to creditors.\u00a0 If additional information would clarify the position for creditors, the proposal will be returned to the submitting party to amend.If a debtor lodges a proposal to terminate, they must be adequately informed of the consequences of termination.\u00a0 The debtor will be ineligible to propose another debt agreement for 10 years.The debtor may propose a termination to be released from the debt agreement to enable them to lodge a debtor\u2019s petition to become bankrupt.If the proposal to terminate is received from a creditor who is not disclosed in the proposal, the creditor should provide both a status report from the administrator and evidence to establish that the creditor is a party to the debt agreement.If a proposal to terminate has already been rejected by creditors, a further proposal to terminate is not accepted unless creditors have indicated they will reconsider a termination or there has been a significant change in the debtor\u2019s circumstances.If completion of the debt agreement occurs before the deadline date for the proposal to terminate, the debt agreement is completed.If a 6-month arrears default occurs before the deadline date for the proposal to terminate, the debt agreement is terminated on that basis.Voting periodThe voting period is 14 days, except in December when it is 21 days.If creditors vote to terminateIf a debt agreement has been terminated, the debt agreement will be recorded on the NPII as terminated and cannot be recorded as completed.\u00a0 This is the case regardless of whether there is an informal arrangement with the debtor to continue making payments.Withdrawing a proposal to vary or terminateA debtor or creditor may withdraw a proposal to vary or a proposal to terminate prior to the voting deadline date.The Official Receiver has the discretion to withdraw a proposal to vary or terminate if there are material reasons for doing so.The Official Receiver may withdraw a proposal to vary or terminate upon becoming aware that the explanatory statement was deficient because:it omitted material information or was incorrect in a material particular, and/ora material change in circumstances that was not foreshadowed is capable of affecting a creditor\u2019s decision whether to accept or not to accept the proposal.The Official Receiver must give the debtor and all parties to the debt agreement notice of any withdrawal of a proposal.If the Official Receiver decides to withdraw a proposal to vary or terminate, the debtor or an affected creditor may apply to the Administrative Review Tribunal for a review of the decision.Six-month arrears default termination of a debt agreementSix-month arrears default occurs when:a debtor does not make any payment for 6 months after the date a payment is duea debtor has not completed all payments and obligations within 6 months after the completion date of the agreement.A 6-month arrears default terminates a debt agreement and compliance checks are made to ensure that the debt agreement is validly terminated before it is recorded on the National Personal Insolvency Index.A debt agreement administrator must notify the Official Receiver on the approved form within 10 working days if there has been a 6-month arrears default by the debtor.An administrator must provide the completed form to Official Receiver with evidence of the 6-month arrears default including:details of amounts and dates due in relation to the payments by the debtor under the debt agreementa list of payments by the debtor showing the total arrears and the date of the last paymentthe date of completion on the original or varied agreement.This information is checked to confirm that a 6-month arrears default has occurred.\u00a0 Where the Official Receiver is satisfied that this has occurred, the termination will be recorded on the NPII.In determining a 6-month arrears default, there is no discretion where evidence proves that a default has occurred.\u00a0

            "IntroductionOne of the general intentions of bankruptcy is to free an insolvent person from their financial obligations arising from debts incurred prior to that person becoming bankrupt.\u00a0 However, while a debtor is released from the majority of categories of unsecured debts at the end of the bankruptcy, there are certain debts from which the bankrupt is not released, and there are other debts from which the bankrupt is released but that, if not paid, will cause the loss of service or supply.Upon bankruptcy, creditors with certain types of debts are not permitted to take action to recover those debts and, instead, they have the right to lodge claims in the bankrupt estate and participate in a dividend, if one is paid.\u00a0 The rights of these creditors to claim in the estate extends only to those debts that were owed when bankruptcy occurred, and not debts incurred on or after the date of bankruptcy.How certain debts are treated in bankruptcy is provided for in various provisions of theBankruptcy Act 1966.\u00a0 This means that debtors, bankrupts, creditors and trustees do not have the power or discretion to determine how debts will be treated.The order of payments from a bankrupt estate, including certain priority dividends to particular categories of creditors, is provided for\u00a0in section 109 of the Bankruptcy Act and section 25 of the Bankruptcy Regulations 2021.\u00a0 This information is summarised inannexure A.Although this practice document has been written with a view to outlining how certain debts are treated in bankruptcy, it can also be applied to debt agreements, personal insolvency agreements and Part XI administrations, as the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act in relation to provable debts apply equally to these administrations.TerminologyAdebtoris any person who owes money.Abankruptis a person who has either had a sequestration order made against their estate or has become bankrupt by virtue of the presentation of a debtor\u2019s petition.Adischarged bankruptorformer bankruptis a person who was bankrupt but whose period of bankruptcy has ended.Acreditoris a person or entity owed money.

of remunerationAs reviews of remuneration or costs are free and may be resource-intensive, they only occur in exceptional circumstances where the criteria outlined in section 90-10 of the Rules are satisfied. \u00a0There is also now provision under paragraph 90-21(2)(a) of the Insolvency Practice Schedule (Bankruptcy) (Schedule 2 of the Bankruptcy Act; \u201cthe Schedule\u201d) for a remuneration (or costs) review to be conducted on the initiative of the Inspector-General or a delegate.The review process consists of two stages by AFSAdeciding whether to conduct a review based on an application or exercise of own initiativeconducting the review (if the application is accepted or own initiative is exercised).TimingThe application by a regulated debtor or creditor must be in writing and, subject to AFSA\u2019s power to extend the period, must be made 20 business days after:the applicant receives a remuneration claim notice (\u201cRCN\u201d) from the trustee (if the debtor or creditor has so elected), orthe end of the administration of the estate.[6]AFSA may extend the 20 business day period before or after it expires to any period considered appropriate if satisfied that:the applicant and the trustee have been engaged in an alternative dispute resolution process to try to resolve the matter, orit is otherwise appropriate, in all the circumstances, to extend the period.[7]Other circumstances[8]when it would be appropriate to extend the period under subsection 90-5(3) of the Rules includes where:the applicant has requested to inspect the accounts and records of the administration but has not yet been able to do so (e.g. because the applicant lives in a remote location and has been unable to attend at the trustee\u2019s office)the applicant has sought a copy of the trustee\u2019s detailed bill of charges and has either not received it or has had insufficient time to examine itthe applicant is otherwise in the process of seeking information from the trustee about the work that has been performed or the remuneration and costs that have been incurredthere are extenuating circumstances of the applicant that contributed to the delay in making the application, such as illness or injury.The applicant may apply to theAdministrative Review Tribunal(\u201cART\u201d) for the review of a decision by AFSA to refuse to extend the period in which an application for review may be made, while the trustee may apply to the ART for a review of a decision to extend the period in which an application for review may be made.[9]When an application for review of remuneration must or may be refusedSubsection 90-10(2) of the Rules provides as follows:(2)\u00a0 The Inspector-General must refuse to accept an application:unless the Inspector-General is satisfied on reasonable grounds that one or more of the following apply:the trustee\u2019s remuneration may have been fixed in a manner that is inconsistent with the requirements of the Act, the regulations or these Rules;the trustee may have acted improperly, or without due care and diligence, in the administration of the estate; orif the Inspector-General is satisfied on reasonable grounds that:the applicant does not have an interest in the outcome of the review; orthe applicant has not adequately particularised the issue giving rise to the review; orthe application is frivolous or vexatious.(3)\u00a0 However, the Inspector-General may accept an application if the Inspector-General is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances to justify the review.(4)\u00a0 The Inspector-General may refuse to accept an application if the Inspector- General is satisfied on reasonable grounds that:it was appropriate in all the circumstances for the applicant to attempt to resolve the matter without seeking a review under this Subdivision; andthe applicant did not do so; andthe applicant did not provide any reasonable explanation for not doing so.An interest in the outcome of the reviewAn \u201cinterest\u201d in the outcome of the review can be regarded as synonymous with a \u201crealistic expectation\u201d of receiving a dividend from the administration in the case of a creditor or a surplus in the case of a bankrupt.Exceptional circumstancesAn application for review of the trustee\u2019s claim for remuneration will only be appropriate where there are exceptional circumstances.[10]Exceptional circumstances may include (but are not limited to):when evidence can be provided by the applicant of errors on the part of the trustee or their staff in procedures under the Bankruptcy Act requiring significant remedial action including work done poorly or, at worst, improperly and needing to be reworkedsystemic and justified complaints having been made to AFSA about the trustee\u2019s conduct, which indicate that the trustee or their staff may have been performing work which is not necessary and/or not properly carried outevidence of inefficiency and/or inappropriate billing practices having been found by the applicant, or by AFSA as a result of the investigation of a complaint, an inspection, or otherwise. \u00a0This may include, for example, inefficient use of staff in the conduct of the administration, charging higher rates for senior staff to carry out routine tasks that ordinarily would be carried out by more junior staff, charging for communicating with AFSA in respect to other than spurious complaints or inordinate delays without a reasonable explanation in the distribution of the estate.Form of applicationThe application for review must be in writing.\u00a0 The suggested form of application,Form 28 \u2013 Application for review of trustee remuneration, is available on the AFSA website.\u00a0 The applicant will need to provide the following information and documentation when applying for the review:their name, address and contact telephone numberthe remuneration claim notice (if any) received from the trustee and the date the notice was receivedin the case of an application by a creditor, the amount claimed to be owed to the creditor and evidence of the creditor\u2019s debt.\u00a0 This \u00a0may include, if appropriate, evidence that the creditor\u2019s proof of debt has been admitted by the trusteethe reason for the application, including the particulars of the specific issue(s) giving rise to the request for reviewwhether a review is sought of all of the trustee\u2019s remuneration or only part of the remunerationthe specific aspects of the remuneration that are disputed.\u00a0 It is not sufficient for an applicant to simply state words to the effect \u201c\u2026every item of work is disputed\u201d without offering specific and detailed reasons whywhat steps if any the applicant has taken to try to resolve the matter with the trustee and, if none were taken, why not.When considering an application by a creditor, AFSA will take into account the fact that creditors have the right to:elect to receive an RCN[11]inspect at all reasonable times, either personally or by an agent, the books kept a trustee relating to a regulated debtor\u2019s estate,[12]and/orrequest the trustee of a regulated debtor\u2019s estate to give information, provide a report or produce a document.[13]These rights, if exercised in a timely manner, should mean that the creditor is able to particularise the issue giving rise to the request for the review.\u00a0 A reason given for a review of \u201cremuneration appears excessive\u201d or similar would not be a sufficient reason on its own to conduct a review, unless exceptional circumstances were known to AFSA. \u00a0Examples of the type of issues that may be considered sufficient to justify a review are:the trustee is a sole practitioner and has charged principal rates for all the tasks carried out in the record of chargeable time that relates to their most recent remuneration claim. \u00a0Many of the tasks were routine and would be expected to be charged out at a lower rate.in the first report to creditors, the trustee omitted several important issues that creditors were expecting to read about and, after intervention by AFSA, the trustee issued a supplementary report, and the trustee has apparently charged the estate for their time dealing with AFSA and preparing the supplementary reportthe trustee has delayed the distribution of money in the estate for an unreasonable period without explanation and has charged the estate for monthly file reviewsthere are joint and separate estates, each with money and each with creditors, yet the trustee has not sought approval for remuneration in each estate and is claiming one sum for remuneration from all estatesthe trustee convened a meeting of creditors to consider a proposal for a composition but gave insufficient notice to creditors, which resulted in an adjournment and a supplementary report to creditors having to be issued, and the trustee\u2019s remuneration claim included this extra activity.If an applicant claiming to be a creditor cannot establish to the satisfaction of AFSA that they are a creditor, their application for review will be rejected.Before deciding whether to conduct a review, and unless the application is rejected for the reasons already mentioned, AFSA may undertake one or more of the following:interview the applicantinterview the trusteeinspect the trustee\u2019s administration file to gauge the level of complexity, standard of administration and veracity of the applicant\u2019s allegations, particularly where more pervasive or systemic problems are alleged by the applicant.Notification of decision refusing applicationSubsections 90-10(5) and (6) of the Rules provide:(5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the Inspector-General refuses to accept the application, the Inspector- General must give the applicant and the trustee written notice of the refusal.(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The notice of refusal must be given to the applicant and the trustee within 10 business days after the day the Inspector-General refuses the application and must include the reasons for the refusal.If AFSA refuses to accept an application for review, the debtor or creditor will be given written notice within 10 business days and include reasons for the refusal.\n\n",

relating to the taxation of solicitor-client costs and for that reason it is likely that should the amount of the solicitor-client costs be very large, a person who is familiar with the assessment of such costs, will be engaged by AFSA to assist in the review.\n\nThe powers of the Inspector-General and the conduct of the reviewSubsection 90-55(3) of the Rules (which applies to both a review of a trustee\u2019s remuneration claim and a review of the costs of a third party service provider) provides as follows:In conducting the review, the Inspector-General may do any of the following:(a)\u00a0 conduct the review:(i)\u00a0 with the parties present; or(ii)\u00a0 on the papers; or(iii)\u00a0 in part with the parties present and in part on the papers;(b)\u00a0 adjourn or discontinue the review if the Inspector-General considers it necessary or appropriate to do so;(c)\u00a0 engage an expert to assist in the review and arrange for payment to be made to the expert;(d)\u00a0 direct the trustee to provide an itemised invoice in a form, and within the time, specified in the direction for work undertaken by the trustee;(e)\u00a0 direct a third party to give an itemised bill of costs in a form, and within the time, specified in the direction in relation to work undertaken by the third party;(f)\u00a0 \u00a0interview any party to the review and allow the other party or their representative to question that party;(g)\u00a0 direct a person to give a written statement, in a specified form and signed by the person, about a matter relevant to the review;(h)\u00a0 direct the trustee to produce to the Inspector-General or to a party to the review, all or part of the trustee\u2019s files or documents in relation to the administration of the bankrupt\u2019s estate;(i)\u00a0 \u00a0copy documents, or arrange for copies to be made and delivered to the Inspector-General or a party to the review;(j)\u00a0 \u00a0direct a party seeking inspection, production or copies of documents to comply with conditions (including conditions relating to payment) in relation to the inspection, production or copying;(k)\u00a0 proceed with the review in the absence of a party if the Inspector-General considers it necessary or appropriate to do so;(l)\u00a0 \u00a0direct the trustee to take particular action for the administration of the estate, including refunding any remuneration not properly claimed or supported.Note: This regulation does not exclude the need for the Inspector-General to provide procedural fairness when conducting the review.The extent and formality of the review will depend on the issue(s) particularised by the applicant and whether the issue is a discrete, isolated item in the course of the administration or a more pervasive or systemic problem.The form that the review takes will vary depending on the issues raised by the applicant and the information known to AFSA about the trustee and the particular administration. \u00a0The review may be:a brief review of a step taken and the associated remuneration charged where an issue raised is isolated, ora comprehensive review in cases involving systemic problems throughout the course of the administration such as, for example, a sole practitioner with no support staff charging principal rates for routine tasks carried out, throughout the administration.Non-compliance with directions by the trustee or a third partyIf a person to whom AFSA gives a direction under the abovementioned powers does not comply with the direction, AFSA may conduct the review on the basis of the information available.[19]If the trustee does not comply with a direction of AFSA under paragraphs 90-55(3)(d), (h) or (l) of the Rules, AFSA may direct that the trustee is not entitled to the remuneration, or part of the remuneration, that is the subject of the review.[20]If a third party does not comply with a direction of AFSA under paragraph 90-55(3)(e) of the Rules, AFSA may order that the trustee may declare and distribute a final dividend in the administration of the regulated debtor\u2019s estate without regard to any claim of the third party. \u00a0Where such an order is made, the estate has no liability to the third party for the bill of costs that is the subject of the review.[21]Information likely to be requiredThe information that is going to be required of a trustee (assuming use of the time-charging method) is the trustee\u2019s itemised record of time charged to the estate also known as the detailed work-in-progress (\u201cWIP\u201d). \u00a0This record will or should identify for each item of work:the date the work was carried outthe name or initials of the staff carrying out the taskthe number of time units spent on the taska description of the work carried outthe charge to the estate for the work carried out.The trustee may be asked to self-assess the detailed WIP and eliminate or reduce entries in respect to:charging for re-work arising from staff errorscharging for multiple and unnecessary redrafting of documentscharging for reviews of files by new staffroutine and non-complex tasks done by senior staff and charged at senior ratescharges for interacting with the regulator except where a repeat unjustified complaint is deemed spuriouscharges unreasonably high or not commensurate with the corresponding task completed.The above are examples only and do not represent an exhaustive list.Other information and documents that may be required:the initial remuneration notice required under section 70-35 of the Rulesthe remuneration report(s) given under section 70-45 of the Rulesthe remuneration claim notice given under section 70-47 of the Rulesthe Form 2 (trustee\u2019s account of receipts and payments) and cashbookif necessary, the administration books including all entries associated with the approval and drawing of remuneration and bank account recordstime sheets and work diaries of trustee and trustee\u2019s staff in so far as they are necessary.GuidanceIn conducting the review, the reviewing officer will refer to the following guidance in considering whether remuneration is appropriate:the Bankruptcy Act (including the Schedule), the Rules (and Standards for registered trustees in Division 42 in particular) and the former RegulationsRemuneration entitlements of a registered bankruptcy trusteeAssessment by the Inspector-General of a trustee\u2019s remuneration approval requestTrustee remuneration notificationsthe ARITA Code (chapters 14 and 15).Principles taken from the above guidance that the AFSA reviewing officer will take into accountRemuneration should be reasonable and should only be charged for work that is both necessary and properly carried out.[22]\u201cNecessary\u201d means connected with the administration and done in furtherance of the exercise of the powers and performance of the duties of a practitioner as required by insolvency law and practice. \u00a0A trustee must not seek to be remunerated for work:outside the scope of the powers of the practitionercarried out before the practitioner was appointed.These restrictions are a threshold test before applying the \u201cnecessary and properly performed\u201d test.Before deciding whether it is appropriate to incur a cost, the trustee must compare the amount of the cost likely to be incurred with the value and complexity of the administration under subsection 42-60(b) of the Rules.[23]Rate for tasks undertaken by the trustee\u2019s staffThe trustee must ensure that time billed for a task undertaken in conducting an administration is charged at the appropriate rate for the level of staff who would be reasonably expected to undertake the task under subsection 42-65(2) of the Rules.How review to be conductedSection 90-55 of the Rules provides:(1)\u00a0 The Inspector-General must conduct the review with as little formality and technicality, and with as much expedition, as the Act and the Regulations, and a proper consideration of the matter, permit.(2)\u00a0 In conducting the review, the Inspector-General:is not bound by legal technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence; andmay inform himself or herself on any matter relevant to the review in such manner as he or she thinks appropriate.Within the above constraints, the review is likely to involve the following steps:ascertaining from the application and an interview of the applicant and the trustee (not necessarily in person) the concerns or issues raised by the applicantcompiling the information and documents required for the reviewchecking that remuneration has been validly approved and that the required notices have been givenperusal of the entries of time charged to the administration to establish that charges are reasonable and only for work that is both necessary and properly performed.\u00a0 Refer toannexuresA and B for further guidance in this regard.Outcome of the reviewSubsection 90-65(2) of the Rules provides:(2)\u00a0 The Inspector-General may:affirm the amount claimed by the trustee or the person who provided services in relation to the administration of the regulated debtor\u2019s estate (a third party) ; ordisallow all or part of the trustee\u2019s claim for remuneration and substitute another amount for the amount claimed; ordisallow all or part of the third party\u2019s bill of costs and substitute another amount for the amount claimed.DecisionWhen AFSA makes their decision, the decision-maker must prepare a written statement[24]that:sets out the decisionsets out the reasons for the decisionsets out the findings on any material questions of factrefers to evidence or other material on which the findings of fact are basedsets out the effect of subsection 90-21(3) of the Schedule in relation to the Inspector- General\u2019s decision (which relates to appeals from that decision \u2013 see paragraph 5.22 below).If the trustee\u2019s remuneration is reduced after review (after being given a copy of the decision), the trustee will be required to repay any excess drawn[25]to the estate by a certain date. \u00a0The repayment of excessive trustee remuneration is recoverable by AFSA as a debt in a Court of competent jurisdiction.TimingAFSA must complete the review and make a decision on the application within 60 days after the day the application is accepted for review[26]and give a copy of the decision to each party to the review, within 10 business days of making the decision.[27]The application will only be accepted for review if and from the time that the applicant provides all necessary information in support of the application.Appeal to the CourtThe trustee, the regulated debtor or a creditor of the regulated debtor may appeal AFSA\u2019s decision to the Court.[28]In addition, if

C of the Schedule, which commenced on 1 September 2017, outlines the record-keeping obligations of trustees who administer a regulated debtor\u2019s estate. \u00a0This division also applies to ongoing administrations that started before 1 September 2017 that have not yet ended.The trustee of a regulated debtor\u2019s estate must, unless they have a reasonable excuse:keep proper books in which entries of minutes of proceedings at meetings and other entries give a complete and correct record of the trustee\u2019s administration of the estate[11]ensure that the books are available at their office for inspection and permit a creditor (or another person acting on the creditor\u2019s behalf) to inspect the books at all reasonable times.The trustee of a regulated debtor\u2019s estate operating a business previously carried on by the regulated debtor must:keep the books that are usually kept in relation to the carrying on of a business of that kind[12]permit a creditor or a person acting on the creditor\u2019s behalf to inspect the books at all reasonable times.Failure to comply with these obligations is a strict liability offence with a penalty of 5 penalty

request of the regulated debtorat the request of a creditorif ordered by a court.[14]If the books of an estate are being audited, the trustee must give the auditor the books, information and assistance that they reasonably require unless they have a reasonable excuse.Failure to comply is a strict liability offence with a penalty of 50 penalty units.Transfer of administration books following a change of trusteeWhere there is a change in trustee of a regulated debtor\u2019s estate on or after 1 September 2017, the former trustee must transfer to the new trustee any administration books that they possess or control.[15]This must be completed within 10 business days from the day after the new trustee\u2019s appointment (or a different period agreed to). \u00a0The former trustee

books as against the new trustee entitled to them, but such lien is not otherwise affected.Retention of administration booksThe last trustee to administer a regulated debtor\u2019s estate must, unless they have a reasonable excuse, retain all books for a period of 7 years from the end of the administration that relate to the estate which they possess or control.[16]Intentional or reckless failure to comply is an offence with a penalty of 50 penalty units.Despite this requirement, books given to the trustee by the regulated debtor may be returned to them within the retention period as directed by:a committee of inspection (if any)otherwise by creditors\u2019 resolution.The trustee may return the books to the regulated debtor or destroy them at the end of the retention period.[17]If another provision of the Bankruptcy Act or another law requires all or part of the administrations books to be kept longer, then the trustee must retain the relevant books for that period.[18]The trustee may at any time return to the regulated debtor or destroy any administration books of the estate that:the trustee thinks will not help the administrationhave been given to any trustee.However, the trustee may not do so if they know, or should reasonably know that:another person had a lien over the books before taking possession of themanother person has a legal right to possession of the booksthey

estate exhibit a correct, full and informative account of the administration.All receipts and payments related to a regulated debtor\u2019s estate must be reflected in the accounts maintained for the administration. \u00a0Every transaction in the bank statements for the administration account should also be recorded in the respective ledger or cash book for that estate.All payments from a regulated debtor\u2019s estate must be verifiable by reference to appropriate supporting physical or electronic vouchers and original documents maintained on the estate file.Where trustees use one payment for bulk transactions to a particular entity, the records supporting the bulk transaction will need to adequately identify the individual estates to which each payment relates. \u00a0The record will need to include:the name of the regulated debtorthe amount attributable to each of themthe date of the payment.This also applies in circumstances where bulk receipts are received.All money received in a regulated debtor\u2019s estate must be deposited into the administration bank account and adequately described to enable identification of the transactions giving rise to the receipt of money. \u00a0The trustee will need to ensure that sufficient information is given to a regulated debtor who intends to make deposits online to ensure the deposits are accurate and easily attributable to a particular estate. \u00a0This will help minimise the risk of unidentified deposits.If a receipt has been reversed in the bank statement due to a dishonoured payment, both the deposit and the reversal entry are to be accurately reflected in the cash book/ledger for the regulated debtor\u2019s estate.Where a payment has been made that needs to be reversed, the money is to be returned and a replacement payment arranged. \u00a0The relevant books for the regulated debtor\u2019s estate will need to record the cancellation of the payment in question and the processing of the new payment.Where an error is found and corrected in a regulated debtor\u2019s estate books or the administration bank account, the identification of the error and the details of the remedial action taken are to be documented. \u00a0The file note recording the identification of the error and the action taken is to be made on or attached to the document in which the error has been found.Journal entries are not to be used to correct an error in the ledger or cash book. \u00a0If an error has been made when recording a receipt or payment in the ledger or cash book, the appropriate actions are to reverse the entry\u00a0 and make a correct entry, rather than using a journal entry to amend the entry.Statements of receipts and payments forwarded to creditors shall accurately and meaningfully reflect the financial transactions of the administration. \u00a0The statements should also be logical, simple to read and help to quickly determine the current status of the administration.Subsection 12(2) of the Bankruptcy Act provides for the Inspector-General being able to require the production of books kept by a trustee.\u00a0 As such, trustees must make books of a regulated debtor\u2019s estate available for inspection on request .[19]File maintenanceTrustees are to maintain relevant books that provide an orderly trail for reviewing decision-making processes. \u00a0These books will

regulating the conduct of personal insolvency practitioners is found within the following:theBankruptcy Act 1966(\u201cthe Bankruptcy Act\u201d), including the Insolvency Practice Schedule (Bankruptcy) (\u201cthe Schedule\u201d)theBankruptcy Regulations 2021(\u201cthe Regulations\u201d)theInsolvency Practice Rules (Bankruptcy) 2016(\u201cthe Rules\u201d).The Bankruptcy Act, Schedule, Regulations and Rules impose a range of duties on personal insolvency practitioners which require them to act independently.Standards for registered trusteesThe Rules impose specific standards for registered trustees to ensure that:they always act according to their powers and duties under the Bankruptcy Act, Regulations and Rules and bankruptcy law practice generallycarry out administrations consistently to a high standard.Division 42 of the Rules outlines the standards for registered trustees to:act honestly and impartially (section 42-10)communicate objectively (section 42-15)notify relevant parties of actual or potential conflicts of interest and take appropriate steps to avoid them (section 42-20)act reasonably when determining ownership of (or an interest in) assets and claim only the amount(s) that fairly represent divisible property (section 42-45)obtain advice from an independent expert when required to assess the value of divisible property likely to have a material impact on the administration (section 42-50)act independently and impartially in undertaking transactions and dealings for the disposal of property (section 42-55).[1]The duties to act honestly and impartially are especially important whenever registered trustees exercise powers under the Bankruptcy Act, including:discretionary powers in subsection 134(1)investigatory powers in sections 19AA, 77A, 81, 139U and subsection 6A(3)recovery powers in sections 129, 120-122, 128B, 128C.The standards apply to registered trustees; however, the Official Trustee will, where appropriate, observe these standards.The standards in Division 42 of the Rules also apply to controlling trustees.Declaring relationshipsSection 189A of the Bankruptcy Act requires a controlling trustee to make a written declaration stating whether they (or their related entity) are related to the debtor. \u00a0A copy must be provided to AFSA and to each of the creditors.In addition, subsection 70-30(3) of the Rules imposes a duty on registered trustees to give a written declaration to creditors at the same time as they first communicate with them about a regulated debtor\u2019s estate stating:whether they, a partner[2]or a body corporate[3](or associate of that body corporate) has had a relationship with the regulated debtor (or their former trustee) within the preceding 24 monthsif so, reasons for believing that none of those relationships result in\u00a0 a conflict of interest or duty.[4]Where a declaration of relevant relationships is given to creditors and it becomes outdated or the trustee becomes aware of an error, subsection 70-51(2) of the Rules requires that a replacement declaration be given to creditors as soon as practicable.Voting entitlementsParagraph 75-100(2)(b) of the Rules imposes a duty on trustees when deciding whether a creditor is entitled to vote at a meeting of creditors. \u00a0This duty requires trustees to act impartially and independently without regard to the regulated debtor\u2019s wishes.OffencesA trustee commits an offence[5]when they agree or offer to give to another person any valuable consideration to secure their own appointment or nomination as a trustee, or secure or prevent the appointment or nomination of someone else as a trustee.Guidelines for registered debt agreement administratorsGuidelines made under section 186Q of the Bankruptcy Act[6]prescribe duties that registered debt agreement administrators must comply with to effectively perform their functions.Central to these are the duties of registered debt agreement administrators to:ensure debt agreement proposals are correctly certified[7]ensure the debtor\u2019s property is dealt with as specified in the debt agreementnot be reimbursed for expenses incurred as administrator unless they are specified in the agreementhandle and properly account for money and keep books and records of the administrationconsider whether a debtor has committed an offence against the Bankruptcy Act and refer to any evidence to AFSA or to a relevant law enforcement authority.Implicit in these duties is that registered debt agreement administrators act honestly and impartially when dealing with debtors, creditors and AFSA.Debt agreement administrator disclosuresNew disclosure and voting measures were introduced under the 2019 debt agreement law reforms to improve transparency and independence in the administration of debt agreements.When an administrator lodges a debt agreement proposal with the Official Receiver, it must be accompanied by a certificate signed by the administrator, stating information that includes whether a person (the broker) referred the debtor to the proposed administrator, and if so, setting out details of the relationship between the broker and the proposed administrator and details of any payments made, or to be made, to the broker by the proposed administrator in connection with that referral.If a creditor under the debt agreement is a related entity of the proposed administrator, the certificate must also specify the name of the creditor and the nature of the relationship between the affected creditor and the proposed administrator.Neither the administrator nor any creditor who is a related entity of the administrator is entitled to vote in relation to the acceptance, variation or termination of the debt agreement.OffencesFor debt agreement proposals lodged on or after 27 June 2019, an administrator commits an offence when they give, agree or offer an affected creditor an incentive for voting on a proposal, variation or termination.Why is independence important?The insolvency profession requires practitioners to act with independence. Personal insolvency practitioners are trustees for property and income received and have a fiduciary relationship to the creditor and debtor. \u00a0As fiduciaries, practitioners must discharge a duty of care to creditors and debtors to properly perform their role, which requires avoiding conflicts of interest.Practitioners also have statutory duties to administer estates/trust funds in the interests of creditors, the person made bankrupt and the debtor and to exercise as a public duty and for the public welfare, certain powers given and duties imposed under the Bankruptcy Act.Common law principlesThe duty of registered trustees to be independent is closely related to their role as fiduciaries and recognition as officers of the Court.[8]Their special position as custodians of regulated debtors\u2019 property on behalf of creditors imposes common law duties on registered trustees to use care and skill and to act in good faith when they administer a personal insolvency.This legislative framework is supported by relevant legal cases in which the Courts have considered and determined whether insolvency practitioners (both personal and corporate) have failed to act honestly or impartially or to avoid conflicts of interest. \u00a0The relevant test for independence or \u201capprehended bias\u201d has been considered and determined by the Courts as being the same test as that which applies to the judiciary and administrative decision makers, namely whether a fair-minded lay observer:is aware of the statutory duties which an insolvency practitioner must discharge impartially and without influence by relationshipsmight reasonably apprehend that the insolvency practitioner might not bring an impartial\u00a0mind to the resolution of the question.[9]This \u201cdouble might\u201d test was applied in the Full Court of the Federal Court matterWalton Constructions Pty Ltd.[10]The Court found that a conflict of interest arose where the liquidators of the company were required to investigate transactions with an entity that also referred work to the liquidators.Practitioners should avoid situations where an appointment might create an obligation that conflicts, or may be perceived to conflict, with the personal interests of them or their firm. \u00a0Courts will remove liquidators (and trustees) in these circumstances, despite potential inconvenience and cost to the liquidation. \u00a0Common law has set the bar high for the degree of independence required of insolvency practitioners.A similar situation relating to liquidators (and which applies similarly to trustees) was explored inRe Allebart Pty Ltd (in Liq.) and The Companies Act\u00a0[1971]1 NSWLR 24 at [28]. \u00a0Street J. (as he then was) said:A liquidator is bound to be on guard lest he compromise his position of independence and impartiality in all respects in the discharge of his functions as an officer of the Court administering the winding up of a company. \u00a0Not only is it his prerogative to decide what steps should be taken, but it is his duty to exercise himself, according to the dictates of his own opinions, what should and what should not be done in the course of any given winding up. \u00a0It is for him to decide what steps are to be taken, and when, how and by what means such steps are to be taken. \u00a0Where he draws upon financial assistance from a creditor, it is incumbent upon him to ensure that he does not place in jeopardy his independence in the discharge of his duties. \u00a0It is indispensable that in point of substance the liquidator\u2019s independence should be preserved; and it is undesirable that a liquidator should permit a situation to develop in which it might appear that he has yielded up in any degree whatever his exclusive independent control in the decision-making processes and administration of a winding up.Given their position as custodians of property, registered debt agreement administrators are similarly regarded as fiduciaries at common law with duties owed to both debtors and creditors for whom they act.Independence of trustees as employeesTrustees in bankruptcy have a common law duty to avoid any conflict of duty or interest whether as the appointee or otherwise.\u00a0 The need for absolute independence prevented employees from becoming registered as trustees for most of the twentieth century as it was perceived that they would be subject to the control of their employers and therefore could not act independently.InRe Partridge(unreported) 22 September 1982, Lockhart J. said of a trustee:He must be scrupulously careful to ensure that he never allows himself to be placed in a position of conflict between various duties or between duty and interest; nor must he ever allow the situation to arise where he may be seen to be in that position of conflict or potential conflict. \u00a0A registered trustee must not only be impartial; he must be seen to be impartial.InRe Lamb[11]at [24], Sweeney J said:The objects of the Act are of public importance and it is of great importance to the community that the role given by the legislature to a trustee, is fulfilled only by persons who are, and who are seen to be, completely independent.Sweeney J\u2019s comments were made in a decision to cancel the registration of a trustee who went from a partner in a firm to an employee in another firm. The Full Federal Court, while citing Sweeney J\u2019s comments with approval, overturned the decision, noting in its judgment the undertakings by the trustee\u2019s employers to respect his independence and not interfere in his engagements as a trustee.[12]The types of arrangements that need to be in place to ensure any applicant for registration as a trustee would be able to avoid conflicts of interest flowing from the dual capacity as trustee and employee were discussed comprehensively inRe Tracy Joy Dare; Ex Parte Tracy Joy Dare Art[1992] FCA 509; (1992) 110 ALR 659 (1992) 38 FCR 356 (21 October 1992).\u00a0 The arrangements are discussed inProcess for registration of trusteesand should be carefully observed by any employee applying for trustee registration.Professional codes and bodiesPersonal insolvency practitioners who are members of professional bodies may also be subject to codes of conduct that regulate their activities.The main professional bodies representing personal insolvency practitioners in Australia are:the Australian Restructuring Insolvency and Turnaround Association (\u201cARITA\u201d)the Association of Independent Insolvency Practitioners (\u201cAIIP\u201d)the Personal Insolvency Professionals Association (\u201cPIPA\u201d)Two of these bodies have professional codes of practice that govern the conduct of their members and provide specific guidance about independence:ARITA Code of Professional PracticePIPA Code of Professional PracticeTheARITA Code of Professional Practice \u2013 Insolvency Servicesdeals extensively with independence, uses an independence hierarchy diagram to set out the test of independence, describes in detail the different circumstances that may be threats to independence and explains the contents required in a Declaration of Independence, Relevant Relationships and Indemnities (\u201cDIRRI\u201d).The ARITA Code incorporates the \u201cdouble might test\u201d but instead of the fair-minded lay observer refers to the \u201creasonable and informed third party\u201d:A member must be seen to be independent, that is, they must not accept an appointment, or continue to act under an existing appointment, if: a reasonable and informed third party; on the information available (or which should have been available) at the time might reasonably form the opinion that the Member might not bring an independent mind to the Administration and thus may not be impartial or may in fact act with bias; because of a lack of independence, or a perception of a lack of independence.ARITA\u2019s Practice Statement 1 \u2013 Independence provides further guidance to its members to assist with the assessment of their independence before and during an appointment. \u00a0ARITA\u2019s Practice Statement 12 provides guidance to members on preparing a DIRRI.Many personal insolvency practitioners are also members of the main professional bodies representing accountants in Australia:CPA Australia (\u201cCPAA\u201d)Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (\u201cCAANZ\u201d)Institute of Public Accountants (\u201cIPA\u201d).These accounting bodies also have professional codes of practice which govern the conduct of their members. \u00a0Members are bound by the code of ethics and standards set by the national Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board (\u201cAPESB\u201d).APESB provides specific guidance to members of CPAA, CAANZ and IPA on independence in these standards and guide:APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional AccountantsAPES 330 Insolvency ServicesIndependence guide.The guide (while specifically aimed at auditors and assurance services) outlines the fundamental principles that members of these bodies must observe and with which they must comply. \u00a0They include integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.The guide also states the following:Independence is linked to the fundamental principles of objectivity and integrity. \u00a0Members are obliged to be straightforward and honest in professional and business relationships and not to allow their judgement to be compromised by bias, conflict of interest or the undue influence of others.Independence comprises:Independence of mindIndependence in appearanceThis means that members must not only act independently but they must also be perceived, by a reasonable and informed third party, to be independent.AFSA supports this position as a set of principles that all personal insolvency practitioners should observe and comply with and which are consistent with the legal duties imposed under the Bankruptcy Act, Regulations and Rules.\n\n",

practitioner.\n\nExamplesPersonal insolvency practitioners might encounter independence issues in various contexts. \u00a0Common examples are outlined below.Third-party referralsIt is accepted practice for personal insolvency practitioners to accept appointments from third parties such as solicitors, accountants (including other insolvency practitioners), creditors, brokers and financial counsellors.However, third-party referrals may compromise the independence of personal insolvency practitioners whenever there is an express arrangement or implicit expectation that:payment will be providedservices will be procured[14]actions will/will not occur.[15]Such arrangements (whether periodic or ongoing) undermine the independence of practitioners by creating actual or perceived conflicts of interest.Every referral will not necessarily result in an independence issue. \u00a0However, practitioners must take care not to make arrangements which might affect their impartiality or create that impression in a reasonable minded observer.Relevant factors to consider include:the frequency and financial value[16]of referrals accepted and services procured from third partiesthe nature and extent of any undertakings sought by or concessions given to third-party referrers.Although not exhaustive, the above are useful indicators that the Courts have considered when asked to review conduct of registered trustees about their independence or conflicts of interest.Another aspect of third-party referrals to which personal insolvency practitioners must be alert are untrustworthy advisors. \u00a0Certain advisors target debtors whose businesses or individual circumstances may be in financial distress and suggest that they take actions which are unethical or illegal (e.g. suggest or arrange the transfer of assets to another person or company without payment). \u00a0These actions can lead to serious consequences for debtors including large fines or imprisonment.We expect personal insolvency practitioners to make appropriate enquiries and conduct reference checks of any advisors from whom they intend to accept referrals to ensure that they do not:provide unqualified or unlawful advice to debtorsfacilitate any voidable transfers to related entities for debtors.Where a personal insolvency practitioner engages with an untrustworthy advisor, either knowingly or unknowingly, the association will attract the attention of AFSA. \u00a0We expect the conduct and decisions of personal insolvency practitioners in an administration to be independent and free from the influence of an untrustworthy advisor. \u00a0Failure to maintain independence from this influence could result in disciplinary sanctions, including cancellation of registration.Professional relationshipsIt is common for personal insolvency practitioners to develop professional relationships in the ordinary course of their business.When they realise assets, registered trustees often engage agents such as:real estate agentsvaluersauctioneerslawyersinsurance brokersstock brokersstock and station agentsadvertisers.Registered debt agreement administrators often engage brokers who advertise debt agreements or develop networks with providers of debt help and financial management services.\u00a0 Administrators must, as a condition of their registration, ensure that any advertisements and promotion of their services, whether done by the administrator or by someone on their behalf, are not false, misleading or deceptive.\u00a0 The advertisement or promotion must also include the registration name and number of the administrator.These professional relationships can adversely affect the independence of personal insolvency practitioners where they create conflicts of interest or give rise to potential breaches of fiduciary duties. \u00a0This might include:services supplied in a personal insolvency administration by an entity in which the appointee has an interest,[17]e.g. a registered trustee engages a solicitor who is also their sibling to recover a voidable transactiona supplier of services used by a practitioner in all personal insolvency administrations without ensuring value for money, e.g. a registered trustee uses a preferred auctioneer to sell any bankruptcy assets without reference to the costs of realisationmarketing done on behalf of a practitioner to generate leads by promoting services to debtors which are misleading, e.g. a broker who advertises debt agreements as \u201cdebt consolidation\u201d[18]a supplier of services offers inducements to a practitioner expecting to be engaged on future appointments, e.g. a registered trustee who regularly accepts invitations to VIP eventsIt is important to recognise and understand that professional relationships are different to one-off commercial transactions. \u00a0Both involve the exercise of judgment to ensure probity, but professional relationships are often more subtle and complex to manage.In this context, personal insolvency practitioners should consider whether a professional they might engage may themselves have an actual or perceived conflict of interest. \u00a0For example, a trustee who intends to realise a residential unit in a bankruptcy arising from unpaid body corporate fees should consider whether engaging solicitors, who act for the petitioning creditor owner\u2019s corporation, to undertake the conveyance might represent either an actual or perceived conflict of interest.Personal insolvency practitioners are exposed to pressures from various sources including debtors, creditors, the Courts, regulators, professional bodies, other professionals, competitors and the general public. \u00a0Effectively balancing these can be challenging and lead some to take risks with their professional integrity and reputation.We expect personal insolvency practitioners to be aware of these risks and seek appropriate guidance from their relevant professional bodies when they have independence concerns.Associated or related entity appointmentsPersonal insolvency practitioners must be careful to avoid potential conflicts of interest involving appointments to an associated or related entity.[19]An associated entity includes a person or private company that is associated with a debtor or bankrupt to which a practitioner may be appointed.A related entity includes:a relative of someone who is a bankrupt or a debtora company of which the debtor or person made bankrupt (or their relative) is a directora beneficiary under a trust of which the debtor or person made bankrupt (or their relative) is a trusteea trustee of a trust under which the debtor or person made bankrupt (or their relative) is a beneficiarya member of a partnership of which the debtor or person made bankrupt (or their relative) is a partner.Registered trustees may be exposed to risks of actual or perceived conflicts by accepting an appointment (sequential or concurrent) from a debtor or someone made bankrupt and an associated or related entity. \u00a0Trustees are expected to anticipate the risks and decline such appointments wherever possible.Issues usually arise when there are disputes between parties over:interests in vesting property (e.g. between spouses, siblings, parents, children)voidable transactions (e.g. loans or gifts to an associated entity or related entity)creditor claims to participate in voting and/or entitlement to dividend paymentWe expect registered trustees to be proactive in minimising risks of disputes before they arise to avoid potentially costly and time consuming action after the fact (e.g. applying to the Court for directions, voluntary resignation or involuntary removal by creditors, the Court reviews into conduct and/or disciplinary proceedings).Before accepting an appointment, registered trustees must sign aForm 12 \u2013 Trustee consent to act declarationunder section 156A of the Bankruptcy Act.\u00a0 The form includes a declaration of relationships that requires disclosure of whether the registered trustee (or their related entities) are related to the debtor to whom the consent relates.Registered trustees should be aware that failure to declare or properly disclose the existence of relationships may expose them to a potential:order of the Court that they cease to be trustee of an estate under paragraph 90-15(3)(b) of the Scheduleoffence referral under paragraph 263(1)(d) of the Bankruptcy Act for making a false declarationdisciplinary action under section 40-40 of the Schedule.Pre-appointment dealingsPersonal insolvency practitioners must take care when accepting appointments where they have had prior professional dealings with debtors. \u00a0This typically includes situations where they may have:provided advice to the debtor on personal or business asset structures or financingprovided advice as an expert witness in a legal action involving the debtor, and/oracted for the debtor in a dispute, e.g. negotiated an informal arrangement with creditors.While meeting with a debtor to discuss their personal insolvency options before a formal appointment is not likely to create an actual or perceived conflict, the examples cited above may do so.Before accepting an appointment in such circumstances, practitioners should ask themselves whether the nature and extent of prior professional dealings with the debtor will (or may):impede or prevent them properly performing their duties or exercising their powersundermine confidence of creditors and/or the general public due to a perceived conflict.AFSA expects that, where the answer to either question is \u201cyes\u201d (and there is no reasonable and practicable way to mitigate these issues), the personal insolvency practitioner will decline the appointment.\n\n",
            "Personal insolvency practitioners might encounter independence issues in various contexts. \u00a0Common examples are outlined below.\n\nThird-party referrals\n\nIt is accepted practice for personal insolvency practitioners to accept appointments from third parties such as solicitors, accountants (including other insolvency practitioners), creditors, brokers and financial counsellors.\n\nHowever, third-party referrals may compromise the independence of personal insolvency practitioners whenever there is an express arrangement or implicit expectation that:payment will be providedservices will be procured[14]actions will/will not occur.[15]\n\npayment will be provided\n\nservices will be procured[14]\n\nactions will/will not occur.[15]\n\nSuch arrangements (whether periodic or ongoing) undermine the independence of practitioners by creating actual or perceived conflicts of interest.\n\nEvery referral will not necessarily result in an independence issue. \u00a0However, practitioners must take care not to make arrangements which might affect their impartiality or create that impression in a reasonable minded observer.\n\nRelevant factors to consider include:the frequency and financial value[16]of referrals accepted and services procured from third partiesthe nature and extent of any undertakings sought by or concessions given to third-party referrers.\n\nthe frequency and financial value[16]of referrals accepted and services procured from third parties\n\nthe nature and extent of any undertakings sought by or concessions given to third-party referrers.\n\nAlthough not exhaustive, the above are useful indicators that the Courts have considered when asked to review conduct of registered trustees about their independence or conflicts of interest.\n\nAnother aspect of third-party referrals to which personal insolvency practitioners must be alert are untrustworthy advisors. \u00a0Certain advisors target debtors whose businesses or individual circumstances may be in financial distress and suggest that they take actions which are unethical or illegal (e.g. suggest or arrange the transfer of assets to another person or company without payment). \u00a0These actions can lead to serious consequences for debtors including large fines or imprisonment.\n\nWe expect personal insolvency practitioners to make appropriate enquiries and conduct reference checks of any advisors from whom they intend to accept referrals to ensure that they do not:provide unqualified or unlawful advice to debtorsfacilitate any voidable transfers to related entities for debtors.\n\nprovide unqualified or unlawful advice to debtors\n\nfacilitate any voidable transfers to related entities for debtors.\n\nWhere a personal insolvency practitioner engages with an untrustworthy advisor, either knowingly or unknowingly, the association will attract the attention of AFSA. \u00a0We expect the conduct and decisions of personal insolvency practitioners in an administration to be independent and free from the influence of an untrustworthy advisor. \u00a0Failure to maintain independence from this influence could result in disciplinary sanctions, including cancellation of registration.\n\nProfessional relationships\n\nIt is common for personal insolvency practitioners to develop professional relationships in the ordinary course of their business.\n\nWhen they realise assets, registered trustees often engage agents such as:real estate agentsvaluersauctioneerslawyersinsurance brokersstock brokersstock and station agentsadvertisers.\n\nreal estate agents\n\nvaluers\n\nauctioneers\n\nlawyers\n\ninsurance brokers\n\nstock brokers\n\nstock and station agents\n\nadvertisers.\n\nRegistered debt agreement administrators often engage brokers who advertise debt agreements or develop networks with providers of debt help and financial management services.\u00a0 Administrators must, as a condition of their registration, ensure that any advertisements and promotion of their services, whether done by the administrator or by someone on their behalf, are not false, misleading or deceptive.\u00a0 The advertisement or promotion must also include the registration name and number of the administrator.\n\n",
            "These professional relationships can adversely affect the independence of personal insolvency practitioners where they create conflicts of interest or give rise to potential breaches of fiduciary duties. \u00a0This might include:services supplied in a personal insolvency administration by an entity in which the appointee has an interest,[17]e.g. a registered trustee engages a solicitor who is also their sibling to recover a voidable transactiona supplier of services used by a practitioner in all personal insolvency administrations without ensuring value for money, e.g. a registered trustee uses a preferred auctioneer to sell any bankruptcy assets without reference to the costs of realisationmarketing done on behalf of a practitioner to generate leads by promoting services to debtors which are misleading, e.g. a broker who advertises debt agreements as \u201cdebt consolidation\u201d[18]a supplier of services offers inducements to a practitioner expecting to be engaged on future appointments, e.g. a registered trustee who regularly accepts invitations to VIP events\n\nservices supplied in a personal insolvency administration by an entity in which the appointee has an interest,[17]e.g. a registered trustee engages a solicitor who is also their sibling to recover a voidable transaction\n\na supplier of services used by a practitioner in all personal insolvency administrations without ensuring value for money, e.g. a registered trustee uses a preferred auctioneer to sell any bankruptcy assets without reference to the costs of realisation\n\nmarketing done on behalf of a practitioner to generate leads by promoting services to debtors which are misleading, e.g. a broker who advertises debt agreements as \u201cdebt consolidation\u201d[18]\n\na supplier of services offers inducements to a practitioner expecting to be engaged on future appointments, e.g. a registered trustee who regularly accepts invitations to VIP events\n\nIt is important to recognise and understand that professional relationships are different to one-off commercial transactions. \u00a0Both involve the exercise of judgment to ensure probity, but professional relationships are often more subtle and complex to manage.\n\nIn this context, personal insolvency practitioners should consider whether a professional they might engage may themselves have an actual or perceived conflict of interest. \u00a0For example, a trustee who intends to realise a residential unit in a bankruptcy arising from unpaid body corporate fees should consider whether engaging solicitors, who act for the petitioning creditor owner\u2019s corporation, to undertake the conveyance might represent either an actual or perceived conflict of interest.\n\nPersonal insolvency practitioners are exposed to pressures from various sources including debtors, creditors, the Courts, regulators, professional bodies, other professionals, competitors and the general public. \u00a0Effectively balancing these can be challenging and lead some to take risks with their professional integrity and reputation.\n\nWe expect personal insolvency practitioners to be aware of these risks and seek appropriate guidance from their relevant professional bodies when they have independence concerns.\n\nAssociated or related entity appointments\n\nPersonal insolvency practitioners must be careful to avoid potential conflicts of interest involving appointments to an associated or related entity.[19]\n\nAn associated entity includes a person or private company that is associated with a debtor or bankrupt to which a practitioner may be appointed.\n\nA related entity includes:a relative of someone who is a bankrupt or a debtora company of which the debtor or person made bankrupt (or their relative) is a directora beneficiary under a trust of which the debtor or person made bankrupt (or their relative) is a trusteea trustee of a trust under which the debtor or person made bankrupt (or their relative) is a beneficiarya member of a partnership of which the debtor or person made bankrupt (or their relative) is a partner.\n\n",

by AFSA of a trustee\u2019s decisions regarding income contribution assessments and any decisions not to adjust income contribution assessments based on hardship. \u00a0Section 139ZIO provides the bankrupt with a right to request review of a trustee\u2019s use of supervised accounts to collect contributions.\u00a0 These requests for review must be made in writing.If appropriate, AFSA will endeavour to assist in facilitating an amicable resolution between the parties where the outcome is likely to be either:the applicant withdraws the application, orthe trustee withdraws their decision.In respect to objections lodged to extend the period of bankruptcy, the right to seek a review is provided in section 149K of the Bankruptcy Act.The comments in this general section apply to all types of reviews listed, apart from a trustee\u2019s decision to claim remuneration.\n\nSection 139ZA of the Bankruptcy Act provides a bankrupt with a right to request review by AFSA of a

section 149K of the Bankruptcy Act.\n\nThe comments in this general section apply to all types of reviews listed, apart from a trustee\u2019s decision to claim remuneration.\n\nHow an Inspector-General review can be initiatedAn AFSA review can arise:if requested by a bankrupt and a delegate of the Inspector-General considers the reasons provided are sufficient to justify the reviewon Inspector-General\u2019s own initiative, orif requested by the Commonwealth Ombudsman.Request for review by the bankruptThe trustee is required to advise the bankrupt of reviewable decisions, the bankrupt\u2019s right of review and the 60-day time limit for requesting a review.\u00a0 The 60-day period starts on the day after the date the bankrupt is notified of the decision.A request to review a trustee\u2019s decision must:be made within 60 days of being notified of the decisionbe in writingbe given to AFSAinclude the reason for requesting the reviewbe accompanied by all relevant information and documentation, including a copy of the trustee\u2019s decision on which review is being sought.A request is considered when all of these conditions are met.In determining whether the request is within time, AFSA requires evidence from the trustee as to when the decision and details of the review rights were provided to the bankrupt.A decision posted by the trustee is deemed to have been received by the bankrupt when a document would, in the due course of post or business practice, be delivered (refer to section 102 of theBankruptcy Regulations 2021).\u00a0 This is by reference to the Australia Post delivery times, which can be found on theAustralia Post website.Once a request for review meeting the prerequisite conditions is received, AFSA has 60 days to reach a decision. \u00a0If a decision is not made within this time, for example if further information is not provided on request, the trustee\u2019s original decision is deemed to be confirmed. \u00a0AFSA will promptly advise the bankrupt of all decisions and further review options.When the conditions are not met, for example if AFSA determines that a request for review is out of time, the request is not considered valid and a review will usually not be made based on the request.\u00a0 AFSA will provide an explanatory letter to the bankrupt outlining the reasons and any further entitlements of the rights of appeal.While the determination of validity of a request is not reviewable in the Administrative Review Tribunal (\u201cART\u201d), a bankrupt is entitled to raise concerns with the Commonwealth Ombudsman.\u00a0 The Ombudsman may direct the Inspector-General to undertake a review notwithstanding it being invalid or, if there are sufficient and reasonable grounds, AFSA may undertake a review based on its own initiative.\u00a0 Details of both these situations are provided below.Review carried out on the Inspector-General\u2019s initiativeAFSA has the discretion to undertake a review of a trustee\u2019s decision at any time. \u00a0AFSA will exercise this discretion reasonably based on the merits and circumstances of each case.Examples for instances where reviews may be carried out on the Inspector-General\u2019s initiative are:Intervention is required in order to maintain the credibility of the personal insolvency system. \u00a0For example, if it was considered that the decision made was a misuse of power by the trustee.It appears that a trustee\u2019s decision was deemed to be a breach of fiduciary duties or otherwise contrary to law.Natural justice should be applied.\u00a0 For example, where the request was received by AFSA outside the time frame allowed because the bankrupt had not been advised of their right of review or had not been advised of the time limit within which to make such a request and it appears there may be some merit in undertaking a review.\u00a0 AFSA may become aware of a trustee\u2019s decision that should be reviewed using this discretion when performing other regulatory functions, such as during the annual inspection program or during the investigation of a complaint.AFSA will advise the trustee of the basis of any cases where this discretion is invoked and it has been decided to review the trustee\u2019s decision.Where a decision to exercise the discretion is based on a request by the bankrupt, it is expected that the bankrupt will provide their reasons for requesting a review and will provide all relevant information and documentation in support of the request.Although the Bankruptcy Act does not specify a timeframe within which such a review decision must be made, AFSA will endeavour to complete the review within 60 days of accepting the review application.Request for review by the Commonwealth OmbudsmanAFSA must conduct a review when requested to do so by the Commonwealth Ombudsman.Examples of when this might occur are where the Commonwealth Ombudsman considers that an administrative error has occurred in the process or there is an issue of natural justice that has not previously been considered.Although the Bankruptcy Act does not specify a timeframe within which a review must be completed in this situation, AFSA\u00a0 will endeavour to complete the review within 60 days of receiving the request from the Commonwealth Ombudsman.How AFSA conducts a reviewWhen AFSA determines that a review will be conducted, notification will be sent to the bankrupt and the trustee.\u00a0 The trustee will be advised of the reasons for the decision to undertake the review or the basis of the bankrupt\u2019s request.\u00a0 Further information may be requested from the bankrupt and/or the trustee if necessary.It is expected that information requested will be provided by the bankrupt and/or the trustee within the time specified by AFSA.AFSA\u2019s notificationWhere additional evidence is provided that will be relied upon by AFSA in making a decision or where existing

invoked and it has been decided to review the trustee\u2019s decision.\n\nWhere a decision to exercise the discretion is based on a request by the bankrupt, it is expected that the bankrupt will provide their reasons for requesting a review and will provide all relevant information and documentation in support of the request.\n\nAlthough the Bankruptcy Act does not specify a timeframe within which such a review decision must be made, AFSA will endeavour to complete the review within 60 days of accepting the review application.\n\nRequest for review by the Commonwealth Ombudsman\n\nAFSA must conduct a review when requested to do so by the Commonwealth Ombudsman.\n\nExamples of when this might occur are where the Commonwealth Ombudsman considers that an administrative error has occurred in the process or there is an issue of natural justice that has not previously been considered.\n\nAlthough the Bankruptcy Act does not specify a timeframe within which a review must be

\u00a0A decision resulting in a bankrupt\u2019s obligations to make contributions is reviewable by AFSA on request by the bankrupt.AFSA expects that the trustee will conduct proper enquiries to assess the bankrupt\u2019s contribution liability and that the trustee will provide sufficient information to enable the bankrupt to understand how the liability was determined and inform the bankrupt of the review rights.AFSA has the power to review an entire income contribution assessment and is not restricted to considering only the areas of the assessment that the bankrupt disputes.In commencing a review, AFSA will initially consider the details of the trustee\u2019s assessment and the information provided by the bankrupt in order to determine whether the trustee has correctly applied the contribution regime.This process can involve a review of the bankrupt\u2019s income, the treatment of the liability for income tax purposes and consideration of the number of dependants the bankrupt has.The possible outcomes of the review are that AFSA can:confirm the trustee\u2019s assessment, orissue a fresh assessment that either increases or decreases the contribution liability.Hardship reviewsWhere a bankrupt receives notice of an income contribution assessment, an application can be made by the bankrupt to the trustee if the bankrupt believes that financial hardship will be suffered if required to pay that contribution.The grounds on which hardship can be claimed are set out in subsection 139T(2) of the Bankruptcy Act. \u00a0These are the only grounds on which hardship can be claimed and neither the trustee nor AFSA has the discretion to make an allowance and reduce the contribution liability on any other basis.Where the bankrupt is not satisfied with the decision made by the trustee in relation to the claim for hardship, the bankrupt can ask for that decision to be reviewed by AFSA.In seeking a review in order to establish hardship it is necessary for a bankrupt to:outline which of the hardship ground(s) in subsection 139T(2) applyprovide adequate evidence in support of the ground(s)quantify the amount of hardship relating to the relevant hardship ground(s)demonstrate that financial hardship will be experienced if required to pay the assessed the contribution.Where AFSA determines, after considering the above factors, that hardship will be suffered by the bankrupt, AFSA may vary the contribution assessment to lower the contribution liability.Review of supervised account noticesWhere a bankrupt is issued with an income assessment and fails to make the required payments, the trustee can issue a supervised account notice to the bankrupt.\u00a0 The effect of the notice is that the bankrupt must open a bank account into which all of the bankrupt\u2019s income is deposited and withdrawals can only be made from the account with the trustee\u2019s permission.The main factors that AFSA considers when reviewing the notice are:whether the bankrupt was liable to pay a contributionwhether the bankrupt was given effective notice of the contribution liability.whether amounts due have been paidwhether the bankrupt has failed to pay a lump sum or instalments due by a particular timewhether the bankrupt has been given an opportunity to comply voluntarilywhether the issue of the notice was an abuse of power or breach of fiduciary duty to act fairly and impartially.In undertaking a review of a supervised account notice, AFSA can:confirm the decisionvary the decisionset aside the decision, orset aside the decision and make a decision in substitute of the decision that is set aside.These provisions do not apply to the situation when the bankrupt disagrees with the contribution assessment on which the supervised account notice is based.\u00a0 A request for review of the contribution assessment can be made as set out above and the conditions outlined above apply.\u00a0 If the conditions are not met, for example the request is out of time, AFSA may still exercise discretion to review the basis of the contribution assessment alongside the review of the supervised account notice if the circumstances warrant this.\n\n",

bankrupt who submits their Debtor\u2019s Petition is generally entitled to receive an automatic discharge from bankruptcy 3 years and 1 day after the date on which the petition was accepted.A debtor who is made bankrupt by a sequestration order is generally entitled to receive an automatic discharge\u00a0from bankruptcy 3 years and 1 day after the date a bankrupt\u00a0files a statement of affairs that we accept.This period can be extended if the trustee files an objection to discharge with the Official Receiver before these times.A bankruptcy trustee must lodge an objection to a bankrupt\u2019s automatic discharge from bankruptcy pursuant to section 149B of the Bankruptcy Act when the trustee believes:that doing so will help make the bankrupt discharge a duty that the bankrupt has not dischargedthat there is no other way for the trustee to induce the bankrupt to discharge any duties that the bankrupt has not discharged.The trustee must also determine that at least one of the grounds of objection, as set out in subsection 149D(1) of the Bankruptcy Act, applies. \u00a0The notice must be lodged with AFSA\u2019s Official Receiver, and a copy of the notice must be provided to the bankrupt.Where an objection is lodged with AFSA on or before the due date for discharge, the period of bankruptcy will be extended to either 5 or 8 years from either the date the debtor\u2019s petition was accepted or, for a sequestration order, when the bankrupt filed a statement of affairs which was accepted. \u00a0The period of bankruptcy will depend on which ground(s) of objection the objection is based.Generally, a ground of objection that results in an 8-year bankruptcy is referred to as a \u201cspecial ground\u201d. \u00a0Ordinary grounds of objection, referred to as \u201cnon-special grounds\u201d in the legislation, generally give rise to a 5-year period of bankruptcy.Information that a notice of objection must containA notice of objection must include the following:details of the ground(s) the trustee relies on to lodge the objection and the ground(s) must be specified in subsection 149D(1) of the Bankruptcy Actthe evidence or other material upon which the trustee relieswhere a non-special ground is relied on, a statement of the trustee\u2019s reasons for filing a notice of objection on that ground.\u00a0 (For special grounds, the trustee is not required to state the reason for objecting on that ground.)AFSA\u2019s expectation is that the trustee will clearly set out all the above information in the notice of objection and that the copy of the notice will be given to the bankrupt within 7 days after the filing of the notice with AFSA.\u00a0 The bankrupt must be advised of the review provisions and the timeframe for seeking a review.If the notice is deficient in any one or more of these requirements, it may be cancelled by AFSA or declared invalid by the court.\u00a0 If there are material deficiencies with the trustee\u2019s notice of objection, AFSA may request that the trustee consider withdrawing the notice.How AFSA conducts an objection reviewAFSA will review the decision to object and the notice of objection to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Bankruptcy Act.\u00a0 AFSA can ask the bankrupt and/or the trustee for further information to assist with the review process.\u00a0 In appropriate circumstances, AFSA may seek to facilitate a resolution of the issues in dispute between the trustee and the bankrupt.When conducting the objection review, AFSA will consider the following:Is the ground(s) of objection on which the objection was made a ground(s) specified in subsection 149D(1) of the Bankruptcy Act?Is there sufficient evidence to support the existence of the ground(s) of objection?Where the objection is based on a non-special ground, do the reasons given for objecting on that ground(s) justify the making of the objection?If AFSA is not satisfied as to one or all of the elements above, the objection must be cancelled.Where additional evidence is provided that will be relied upon by AFSA in making a decision or where existing evidence has been challenged, parties will be given the opportunity to respond to the fresh evidence or issues raised as a matter of natural justice.Where an objection is cancelled by the AFSA, the cancellation does not take effect until either:the end of 28 days from the date that the bankrupt and the trustee receive the Inspector-General\u2019s decision, being the period within which an application can be made for a review of that decision to the A ART, orif such an application is made, the date the decision of the ART is given.AFSA Practitioner Surveillance will advise the AFSA Official Receiver where an objection has been cancelled so that the National Personal Insolvency Index can be updated.Once an objection based on a certain set of circumstances has been cancelled, a trustee is unable to lodge a fresh objection based on the same ground and circumstances.Considerations for special groundsWhere a ground of objection is a special ground, a trustee is not required to state the reason(s) for the objection.AFSA may cancel a special ground of objection where:the ground(s) and/or evidence is/are not established, orthe ground(s) and evidence have been established but the bankrupt has satisfied the Inspector-General that there was a reasonable excuse for the conduct or failure that gave rise to the special ground.AFSA will consider the information and evidence provided by the bankrupt and rely on case law as appropriate to determine whether or not the excuse offered is \u201creasonable\u201d.\u00a0 The trustee will be given details of the bankrupt\u2019s information and evidence, as well as the opportunity to provide comments and evidence refuting the bankrupt\u2019s claim to have a reasonable excuse.\u00a0 Consideration will be given to the conduct of the bankrupt and the circumstances of the administration of the bankrupt estate.If the bankrupt establishes that they had a prior reasonable excuse for failing to discharge the duty on which the notice is based but that, despite subsequent opportunity, they are still to remedy the conduct giving rise to the objection, it is unlikely that the excuse provided will be accepted as sufficient reason for the failure to comply with a particular ground.AFSA Practitioner Surveillance has no power to cancel the objection based on special grounds simply because the bankrupt has remedied the conduct and/or circumstances that led to the objection.\u00a0 However, in cases where the conduct that gave rise to the objection has been remedied, it is AFSA\u2019s expectation that the trustee will withdraw the objection unless there is some future benefit to the objection remaining in place.In the situation where an objection was lodged on more than one ground, it cannot be cancelled if one special ground is established.[1]Considerations for non-special groundsWhere an objection is lodged on an ordinary or non-special ground, the trustee must specify a reason for the making of the objection on that ground. The objection must not be lodged to punish the bankrupt but must set out what purpose it seeks to achieve. It must state how the extension of the period of bankruptcy will provide a utility not otherwise available were the bankrupt to be discharged from bankruptcy.The courts have considered the following examples to be valid reasons demonstrating utility in certain circumstances:to provide the bankrupt the opportunity to co-operate more fully with the trustee in the administration of their estate and to comprehensively meet their obligations to be forthcoming and frank in the information provided to the trustee, particularly when their obligation of full disclosure and duty to assist the trustee to the utmost of their power would be significantly reduced if they were to be discharged from bankruptcyas a matter of public interest by ensuring that a bankrupt meets their requirements of transparency and candour under the Bankruptcy Act, so as to assist the trustee to the utmost of their power.Guidance for trustees on the proper use of the objection to discharge provisions is available inObjections to discharge from bankruptcy.\n\n",

            "IntroductionThis practice document provides practitioners an outline of realisations and interest charge and guidance on how these charges are calculated, with supporting examples.The realisations chargeThe realisations charge is a levy imposed by the government to fund the cost of certain activities undertaken byAFSAthat benefit the personal insolvency system. \u00a0These include the regulation of the personal insolvency system, investigation and prosecution of breaches of personal insolvency law and enquiries to estates being administered by the Official Trustee where potential assets or offences appear to be involved.The realisations charge is payable on receipts in bankruptcies, post-bankruptcy compositions (section 73 of theBankruptcy Act 1966), controlling trustee authority administrations and personal insolvency agreements (Part X), insolvent deceased estate administrations (Part XI) and debt agreements (Part IX).The rules that govern how the charge is calculated are contained in theBankruptcy (Estate Charges) Act 1997(\u201cthe Estate Charges Act\u201d).Certain deductions within an administration are permitted, such as payments to secured creditors.\u00a0 Other types of receipts, for example creditor indemnities, may not attract the levy.The total amount upon which the levy is calculated is also limited to the amount that is required to pay all the costs and debts of the administration.\u00a0 Part 3 below provides examples that illustrate how the realisations charge is calculated in various situations, including where realisations exceed the amount required to pay costs plus debts.The realisations charge rate is presently 7%.\u00a0 The rate is set by a Determination, which is currently theBankruptcy (Estate Charges) (Amount of Charge Payable) Determination 2015, and it is reviewed periodically.\u00a0 The rate is published on theFees and chargespage of the AFSA website and practitioners are advised of any rate change prior to the date the change takes effect.\u00a0 Historical rates are available inannexure B.The interest chargeThe interest charge is the interest earned by trustees and administrators (\u201c'practitioners\u201d) on money held on trust. \u00a0This interest income is payable to the government. \u00a0It is used to offset the cost of activities that benefit the entire personal insolvency system, as with realisations charge.The interest charge is the total interest earned by practitioners on trust money held in:bankruptciesbankruptcy compositionscontrolling trustee authority administrationspersonal insolvency agreementsinsolvent deceased estate administrationsdebt agreements.Where the practitioner is charged by a bank for the maintenance of an account, the amount paid is an allowable deduction for the purposes of the interest charge calculation. \u00a0Where a practitioner operates a single bank account for all their administrations, the interest charge is not required to be calculated for each administration separately.Payment of the realisations and interest chargesThe liability for payment of the realisations and interest charges is that of the practitioner (see subsections 5(3) and 6(2) of the Estate Charges Act). \u00a0The amount of charge paid is borne by the administration.Interest and realisations charges are payable at the end of each financial year. \u00a0The due date for payment is 35 days after the end of the financial year.The due date may alter from year to year but will fall in early August.Practitioners may choose to make interest charge and realisations charge payments at any time before the due date.\u00a0 However, the assessment of the total liability is done after the due date each year and coincides with the lodgment of an annual administration return (\u201cAAR\u201d) by the practitioner.Payments can be made via electronic funds transfer\u00a0or credit card.\u00a0 The preferred method of payment is electronic funds transfer.\u00a0 All payments should be made as per instructions on the payment advice available on theAAR online webpage.\u00a0 The payment advice is to be used for all payment methods, including all AAR periods and administrations for that practitioner.Practitioners can check the status of their payments through the AAR online website.\u00a0 Up to 3 business days should be allowed for payments to appear in the practitioner\u2019s AAR payment history, to cater for processing timeframes.Any enquiries about the AAR process can be made by visiting theAAR online webpage.Liabilities of less than $10Where the interest charge or realisations charge liability calculated for an estate is less than $10, this amount is not payable (see subsections 5(1A) and 6(1A) of the Estate Charges Act).\u00a0 It is important to note that these provisions are applicable where the total amount of the charge payable in the financial year is less than $10 (i.e. where total realisations are no more than about $143), andnotwhere the amount of any particular underpayment is less than $10.Where either the interest or realisations charges calculated for an estate is less than $50, the practitioner can elect to defer that payment until the amount due is more than $50 or until the relevant estate is finalised, whichever comes first. \u00a0Under section 280 of the Bankruptcy Act, written notification of this election needs to be made to the Inspector-General via email toPractitionerSurveillance@afsa.gov.au.Late payment penaltiesA penalty of 20% per annum is payable on the amount of interest and realisations charges outstanding for the period during which the amount remains unpaid. \u00a0The penalty is payable by the practitioner. \u00a0Under section 281 of the Act, The practitioner cannot recover the penalty from the estate.Where a practitioner believes that a payment for realisations or interest charge will be made after the due date, the practitioner can make application to the Inspector-General for an extension of time to make payment. \u00a0Requests can be made to the Inspector-General via email toPractitionerSurveillance@afsa.gov.au.Extensions of time for paymentThe Inspector-General has the discretion to extend the time for payment of the charges in certain circumstances. \u00a0The practitioner will need to make an application for an extension of time before the due date for payment, and the application must set out the reason(s) why an extension is sought. \u00a0Applications to extend the time for payment can be to the Inspector-General via email toPractitionerSurveillance@afsa.gov.au.The Inspector-General\u2019s decision on the application is reviewable by theAdministrative Review Tribunalunder section 282 of the Bankruptcy Act.Remission of the realisations charge, interest charge or late payment penaltiesThe Inspector-General may remit an amount of charge or penalty that is payable but that has not been paid if the Inspector-General thinks that failure to remit \u00a0the amount would cause the practitioner undue hardship and that it is appropriate to remit that amount. \u00a0The application can only be made by a practitioner and needs to be in writing setting out the basis on which the remission is sought.The Inspector-General\u2019s decision on the application is reviewable by the Administrative Review Tribunal under section 283 of the Bankruptcy Act.Application for remission of the charges or penalty can be made to the Inspector-General via email toPractitionerSurveillance@afsa.gov.au.Administrations that are set aside by the CourtWhere an administration is set aside by the Court (as opposed to being annulled under subsection 153B of the Bankruptcy Act), the administration never existed and any realisations that a practitioner may have had in that estate will not be subject to the realisations and interest charges. \u00a0In these instances, a formal remission application is not required and a copy of the order of the Court sent to AFSA will suffice. \u00a0(It is noted that the setting aside of an administration by the court is rare.)InWenkart v Pantzer[2003] 132 FCR 273, the Court considered whether payments received by a trustee after a bankruptcy was annulled under section 153B will attract realisations charge.\u00a0 Lindgren J held that:\u2026in order for the realisations charge to be attracted, there must be an amount received by a person who, at the time of receipt, bears the capacity of, relevantly, the trustee of the estate of a bankrupt, and that the amount must be received by that person in that capacity.Reconciliation of amounts paidThe AAR provides summary details of all financial transactions in estates administered by the relevant practitioner. \u00a0A calculation of the realisations charge liability is made based on the information provided in the AAR. \u00a0That information is matched with the realisations charge payments that have been made by the practitioner for that financial year.The accuracy of the information disclosed on the AAR may be verified during our practitioner inspection programme.\n\n",

for registered trustees (in Subdivisions A and D) of the Rules.It should be noted that, pursuant to section 210 of the Bankruptcy Act, the provisions of Part VIII of the Bankruptcy Act apply also to controlling trustees, subject to modifications set out in section 64 and Part 2 of Schedule 3 of the Bankruptcy Regulations.Further, it is noted that, pursuant to subsection 211(1) of the Bankruptcy Act, sections 77, 77A, 77C, 77D, 77E, 77F, 78 (other than paragraphs 78(1)(a), (b) and (c)) and 81 of the Bankruptcy Act apply also to controlling trustees, subject to modifications set out in regulation 10.08 and Part 3 of Schedule 3 of the Bankruptcy Regulations.Legal impact of a section 188 controlling trustee authorityA trustee or solicitor approached by a debtor to become their controlling trustee will need to establish that the debtor is eligible to have their affairs dealt with under Part X of the Bankruptcy Act. \u00a0In this regard, the solicitor or trustee will need to confirm that:the debtor satisfies the requirements of subsection 188(1) of the Bankruptcy Act. \u00a0A debtor may only give a controlling trustee authority if they are personally or ordinarily resident in Australia, have a house or business in Australia, carry on business in Australia or they are a member of a partnership carrying on business in Australiathe debtor is insolvent in the sense that they are not able to pay all their debts as and when they become due and payable[1]the debtor has not signed a previous authority within 6 months of signing the current authority without leave of the Court to do so[2]the debtor is not an undischarged bankrupt.[3]Pursuant to subsection 188(2AA) of the Bankruptcy Act and section 59 of the Bankruptcy Regulations, the controlling trustee must inform the debtor proposing to execute the section 188 authority of the effects of same and the alternatives to a personal insolvency agreement (\u201cPIA\u201d).A section 188 authority will be void where it fails to name the person being authorised by the debtor.[4]On signing the authority, the debtor commits an act of bankruptcy.[5]An authority becomes effective once the controlling trustee accepts the appointment by signing the controlling trustee authority form and, pursuant to subsection 188(2C) of the Bankruptcy Act, the debtor has provided the controlling trustee with aForm 3 \u2013 Statement of affairsand a proposal for dealing with the debtor\u2019s affairs. \u00a0In accordance with subsection 188(2E) of the Bankruptcy Act, the proposal must include a draft personal insolvency agreement.Once an effective authority is in place, it cannot be revoked by the debtor.[6]The controlling trustee acquires control over the debtor\u2019s property[7]and may exercise powers in relation to it,[8]until one of the events detailed in subsection 189(1A) of the Bankruptcy Act occurs.Under subsection 190(2) of the Bankruptcy Act, the controlling trustees is empowered to:take immediate control of the debtor\u2019s property and affairsmake such enquiries and investigations in connection with the debtor\u2019s property and examinable affairs as the trustee considers necessarycarry on a business of the debtor if, in the opinion of the trustee, it will be in the interests of the creditors to do sodeal with the debtor\u2019s property in any way that will, in the opinion of the trustee, be in the interests of the creditors.The debtor\u2019s property does not vest in the controlling trustee as it does in the trustee of a bankruptcy. \u00a0Subsection 190(4) of the Bankruptcy Act provides for the controlling trustee acting in the name of the debtor as if they had been duly appointed as their lawful attorney.[9]A charge is created over the debtor\u2019s property subject to control.[10]The debtor\u2019s responsibility and rights in relation to their property become subject to the limitations set out in subsection 189(2) of the Bankruptcy Act. These include:not removing, disposing of or dealing with any of their property except with the consent of the controlling trusteefurnishing to the controlling trustee such information with respect to any of the debtor\u2019s examinable affairs as the controlling trustee requirescomplying with any direction given to then by the controlling trustee with respect to their property or affairs.The debtor may commit an offence if, inter alia, within 12 months of signing the authority they disposed of, or created a charge on, any property with intent to defraud their creditors[11].Pursuant to section 189AAA of the Bankruptcy Act, where there is a creditor\u2019s petition on foot and a controlling trustee authority given by the debtor becomes effective, proceedings in respect of the creditor\u2019s petition are stayed. \u00a0The stay remains in place until a meeting of creditors called under the authority is concluded or adjourned, whichever is sooner.\n\n",

generally not in a position to obtain information, they rely almost exclusively on the controlling trustee to provide relevant information in the report. \u00a0However, in carrying out investigations, the controlling trustee is limited by time[19]and the information available to them.It is difficult to prescribe the extent of investigations needed to meet the requirements. \u00a0The extent of the controlling trustee\u2019s inquiries will depend on the individual circumstances and complexity of the debtor\u2019s affairs.Sections 42-220 and 42-225 of the Rules[20]outline the minimum detail to be investigated and matters to be included in a controlling trustee\u2019s report to creditors, pursuant to section 189A of the Bankruptcy Act.Pursuant to paragraphs 189A(1)(a) to (c) of the Bankruptcy Act, the controlling trustee\u2019s report must include the following content:a summary of and comment on the information about the debtor\u2019s affairs that is available to the controlling trusteea statement as to whether the controlling trustee believes that creditors\u2019 interests would be better served:- by accepting the debtor\u2019s proposal for dealing with their affairs under Part X, or- by the bankruptcy of the debtornaming each creditor who was identified as a related entity of the debtor in the debtor\u2019s statement of affairs.Controlling trustees may utilise sections 77,77A, 77AA, 77C and 81 of the Bankruptcy Act to empower adequate investigations.[21]In accordance with subsection 42-220(2) of the Rules, if the debtor\u2019s property includes significant real estate, company structures or motor vehicles, the controlling trustee must search the appropriate registries for information about the property and obtain independent expert advice about the value of the property.Pursuant to subsection 42-220(3) of the Rules, if the debtor was or is involved in significant corporate or trust activity, the controlling trustee must take appropriate steps to identify the assets of the debtor that will be subject to the PIA, including making inquiries of third parties such as solicitors, accountants, creditors, associated entities and financial institutions, to establish whether there is any divisible property or antecedent transactions.In addition, sections 42-215 and 42-225 of the Rules prescribe that the following information must also be included in the section 189A report as a minimum:the debtor\u2019s name, date of birth, address and occupationinformation about each matter mentioned in subsection 188A(2) of the Bankruptcy Act (i.e. the proposed elements or required contents of the PIA)the basis on which the debtor\u2019s property has been valuedthe kind of investigations the controlling trustee has carried out and whether any other matters need to be investigatedthe reasons for the controlling trustee\u2019s opinion about whether creditors\u2019 interests would be better served by accepting the debtor\u2019s proposal or by the bankruptcy of the debtor.[22]It is also expected as best practice that the following information be included in section 189A reports:comparison of the estimated dividend under the PIA proposal and bankruptcya list of all creditors and the amount of each debtdetails of the controlling trustee authority, including the relevant dates and its effecta brief financial history of debtor including cause of insolvency.Four main cases that provide parameters on what is expected of controlling trustees\u2019 investigations and reports are discussed below.McDougall[23]InMcDougall, the controlling trustee identified the existence of a family trust, set out a number of the trust\u2019s activities and made it clear in the report that, in the event of bankruptcy, the trustee would most likely have access to trust assets, pursuant to section 139D of the Bankruptcy Act.The controlling trustee\u2019s report recited the debtor\u2019s description of how his financial difficulties had arisen and his explanation of the circumstances in which specific debts disclosed by his statement of affairs had been incurred. \u00a0The report noted that the debtor had no immediate prospects of being able to pay his debts and had therefore submitted a proposal for consideration by his creditors. \u00a0The report recommended that creditors not accept the proposal.The primary judge, Goldberg J, examined whether the trustee\u2019s report set out sufficient information. \u00a0It was submitted by the applicant that:the report showed that the Trustee had not made enquiries in relation to the Debtor\u2019s family trust.Goldberg J\u2019s conclusions, however, were as follows:It is apparent from the report that the Trustee had identified the existence of the family trust company and the report set out a number of its activities and affairs. \u00a0Further, the Trustee made it clear in paragraph 19 of the report that in the event of bankruptcy of the Debtor, the Trustee \u201cwould most likely have access to the assets of The Stuart McDougall Family Trust pursuant to provisions of Section 139D of the Act\u201d. \u00a0I therefore reject the submission that the report shows that the Trustee had not made all necessary enquiries in relation to the Trust within the time available to him. \u00a0In any event, upon the proper construction of s 189A(2)(b) the Trustee was only obliged to set out such information relevant to the affairs of the Debtor as was available to him. \u00a0His only obligation to set out such information as was necessary to give a true and fair view of the Debtor\u2019s affairs was if that information was, in fact, available to him.When the matter went to appeal on other grounds Ryan, Whitlam and Marshall JJ went on to highlight and confirm comments made in an earlier decision:[24]A controlling trustee has marked advantages over the general body of creditors. \u00a0His position as controlling trustee gives him access to the business and financial records of the debtor (s 189(1)). \u00a0The debtor is required to furnish him with such information with respect to any of the debtor's examinable affairs as the controlling trustee requires, and to comply with any directions given to him by the controlling trustee (s 189(2))....\u2026The controlling trustee may, with the consent in writing of the debtor, obtain such advice or assistance as he thinks necessary (see s 190(5A)).\u2026The controlling trustee can explore the possibility that there may be antecedent transactions by the debtor which may be set aside, to the benefit of the creditors, in the course of the administration of his estate, if an order of sequestration were made.McDougallthen is a useful guide, particularly where companies and trusts are involved, supporting the view that enquiry is necessary to ascertain and report on their activity, their worth, the debtor\u2019s involvement and major transactions involving the debtor; in order to allow the trustee to comment on the effect of bankruptcy, particularly in respect to section 139D of the Bankruptcy Act, possible deeming of income and contributions, and possible voidable transactions.Messina[25]InMessina,Goldberg J (who also was the primary judge inMcDougall) had to firstly decide whether a creditor was entitled to vote at the meeting. \u00a0He decided that the creditor, a related entity, was not a creditor and not entitled to vote. \u00a0He was then asked to decide whether the controlling trustee had failed in his duty by admitting the creditor to vote purportedly without adequately investigating the debt. \u00a0Goldberg J stated:... Although the trustee made a number of mistakes in relation to the work he undertook, I am satisfied that the information supplied to Mr Burridge and the trustee and the circumstances surrounding that information was such that the trustee did not act in breach of such duty as was imposed on him by s 190(2)(b) of the Act to make enquiries and investigations in connection with the debtor's property and examinable affairs ...... It must be remembered that the trustee has a limited time within which to make the enquiries and carry out the investigations as the creditors' meeting must be held not later than 35 days after the authority is signed by the debtor: s 194(1)(a) of the Act.The trustee does not have the time, and is not under an obligation, to undertake an audit of the debtor\u2019s affairs. \u00a0As Olney J said in Re Horne; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Horne and Pratt* (supra):\u201cWhat is clear is that the legislation does not require the controlling trustee to audit the debtor's statement of affairs and to certify to the creditors the correctness or otherwise of the statement. \u00a0His power to inquire and investigate is limited to matters he considers necessary. \u00a0In every case it will be for the controlling trustee consistent with his duty to the creditors to determine what inquiries and investigations are necessary. \u00a0The trustee's ultimate function is to ensure that he can express the opinion required by s 189A(3) with such a degree of authority that the creditors can confidently act upon the opinion if they so desire.\u201d*Re Horne; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Horne and Pratt (unreported, 10 May 1996)The controlling trustee made enquiries of the debtor and his accountant, who was also the accountant for the family company claiming to be a creditor, asked for evidence from the accountant and prior to the meeting saw a company balance sheet. \u00a0The Court thought this to be sufficient enquiry into those particular issues and appropriate reporting.Moustafa[26]InMoustafa, Marshall J outlined the powers and responsibilities of a controlling trustee. \u00a0This case puts the Court\u2019s views quite firmly in relation to what is expected of a controlling trustee\u2019s report:The purpose of the controlling trustee\u2019s report is to fully apprise the creditors as to the debtor\u2019s affairs so that the creditors can make an informed decision on whether their best interests would be served by accepting the debtor\u2019s proposal or by bankruptcy of the debtor. \u00a0It is essential for the controlling trustee to ensure that all facts material to the debtor\u2019s affairs are brought to the attention of the creditors in the report and that the statement of belief of the controlling trustee is properly based.Wong[27]As a result of repeated errors identified by AFSA Enforcement and Practitioner Surveillance across a range of personal insolvency matters (including the failure to adequately investigate and report on debtor\u2019s affairs in section 189A reports), the Inspector-General convened a disciplinary committee[28]to consider Mr Luke Ching Wong\u2019s continued registration as a trustee.By Committee Report dated 5 September 2006, it was decided that Mr Wong should cease to be registered as a trustee under the Bankruptcy Act.Mr Wong appealed the committee\u2019s decision to the Administrative Review Tribunal (\u201cthe ART\u201d) where it was argued, on behalf of Mr Wong, that as controlling trustee under Part X, there was limited time and ability to make full enquiries.In upholding the committee decision that Mr Wong be deregistered, Mr B H Pascoe, Senior Member of the ART, stated at [12]:It is accepted that a trustee under the Act has an onerous duty. \u00a0Particularly in Part X arrangements, the trustee has limited time and limited coercive powers. \u00a0However as stated in Muir v Bradley (1984) 57 ALR 155:\u201ca trustee in bankruptcy is a person who must command and retain the confidence of the court, of the creditors and debtors in bankruptcy proceedings and of the general community. \u00a0His competence must be, and remain, of a high order.\u201dAnd Mr Pascoe concluded (at paragraph 14):... having fully considered the report of the Committee, the acceptance of the factual findings of that Committee and the number of breaches relative to the number of files inspected it would be inappropriate to allow Mr Wong to retain his registration.Investigation and reporting principlesWe can conclude that a controlling trustee is required to carry out investigations and report to creditors pursuant to section 189A of the Bankruptcy Act in a relatively short time frame and that the report is critical to the course of the Part X administration. \u00a0Controlling trustees should use the powers available to them to undertake some enquiries, and both McDougall and Messina provide a useful guide as to what enquiries might be expected and what should be reported to creditors.A number of fundamental principles can be drawn from these cases.The fiduciary duty owed to creditors by the controlling trustee must inform preparation of the section 189A report.\u00a0\u00a0A controlling trustee must act in an impartial and independent manner and be impartial to the wishes of the debtor. \u00a0This includes when investigating the debtor\u2019s affairs, reporting to creditors and ruling on the admission of creditors\u2019 proofs of debts for voting purposes.The purpose of the section 189A report is to apprise the creditors as to the debtor\u2019s affairs so that creditors can make an informed decision on whether to accept the debtor\u2019s proposal.The report should be fair and unbiased and summarise the material information available to the controlling trustee.The controlling trustee is not required to audit the debtor's statement of affairs and to certify to creditors the correctness or otherwise of the statement. \u00a0Their power to inquire and investigate is limited to matters considered necessary. \u00a0The controlling trustee has a duty to the creditors to determine what inquiries and investigations are necessary. \u00a0The trustee\u2019s ultimate function is to ensure that they can express the opinion required by subsection 189A(3) of the Bankruptcy Act with such a degree of authority that the creditors can confidently act upon the opinion if they so desire.What is considered necessary and material is subject to the judgment of the controlling trustee. \u00a0However, it is the Inspector-General\u2019s expectation that the \u201creasonable person\u201d test should apply. \u00a0For example, where the debtor is the director and shareholder of a private company operating the family business, it is not reasonable to only report the existence of the company and the debtor\u2019s shareholding. \u00a0A reasonable person would consider that material information would include the company\u2019s assets, a summary of its activities and the debtor\u2019s involvement, whether loans and gifts have been investigated for possible antecedent transactions and whether income contributions were possible.\n\n",
            "As creditors are generally not in a position to obtain information, they rely almost exclusively on the controlling trustee to provide relevant information in the report. \u00a0However, in carrying out investigations, the controlling trustee is limited by time[19]and the information available to them.\n\nIt is difficult to prescribe the extent of investigations needed to meet the requirements. \u00a0The extent of the controlling trustee\u2019s inquiries will depend on the individual circumstances and complexity of the debtor\u2019s affairs.\n\nSections 42-220 and 42-225 of the Rules[20]outline the minimum detail to be investigated and matters to be included in a controlling trustee\u2019s report to creditors, pursuant to section 189A of the Bankruptcy Act.\n\nPursuant to paragraphs 189A(1)(a) to (c) of the Bankruptcy Act, the controlling trustee\u2019s report must include the following content:a summary of and comment on the information about the debtor\u2019s affairs that is available to the controlling trusteea statement as to whether the controlling trustee believes that creditors\u2019 interests would be better served:- by accepting the debtor\u2019s proposal for dealing with their affairs under Part X, or- by the bankruptcy of the debtornaming each creditor who was identified as a related entity of the debtor in the debtor\u2019s statement of affairs.\n\na summary of and comment on the information about the debtor\u2019s affairs that is available to the controlling trustee\n\na statement as to whether the controlling trustee believes that creditors\u2019 interests would be better served:- by accepting the debtor\u2019s proposal for dealing with their affairs under Part X, or- by the bankruptcy of the debtor\n\n- by accepting the debtor\u2019s proposal for dealing with their affairs under Part X, or\n\n- by the bankruptcy of the debtor\n\nnaming each creditor who was identified as a related entity of the debtor in the debtor\u2019s statement of affairs.\n\nControlling trustees may utilise sections 77,77A, 77AA, 77C and 81 of the Bankruptcy Act to empower adequate investigations.[21]\n\nIn accordance with subsection 42-220(2) of the Rules, if the debtor\u2019s property includes significant real estate, company structures or motor vehicles, the controlling trustee must search the appropriate registries for information about the property and obtain independent expert advice about the value of the property.\n\nPursuant to subsection 42-220(3) of the Rules, if the debtor was or is involved in significant corporate or trust activity, the controlling trustee must take appropriate steps to identify the assets of the debtor that will be subject to the PIA, including making inquiries of third parties such as solicitors, accountants, creditors, associated entities and financial institutions, to establish whether there is any divisible property or antecedent transactions.\n\nIn addition, sections 42-215 and 42-225 of the Rules prescribe that the following information must also be included in the section 189A report as a minimum:the debtor\u2019s name, date of birth, address and occupationinformation about each matter mentioned in subsection 188A(2) of the Bankruptcy Act (i.e. the proposed elements or required contents of the PIA)the basis on which the debtor\u2019s property has been valuedthe kind of investigations the controlling trustee has carried out and whether any other matters need to be investigatedthe reasons for the controlling trustee\u2019s opinion about whether creditors\u2019 interests would be better served by accepting the debtor\u2019s proposal or by the bankruptcy of the debtor.[22]\n\nthe debtor\u2019s name, date of birth, address and occupation\n\ninformation about each matter mentioned in subsection 188A(2) of the Bankruptcy Act (i.e. the proposed elements or required contents of the PIA)\n\nthe basis on which the debtor\u2019s property has been valued\n\nthe kind of investigations the controlling trustee has carried out and whether any other matters need to be investigated\n\nthe reasons for the controlling trustee\u2019s opinion about whether creditors\u2019 interests would be better served by accepting the debtor\u2019s proposal or by the bankruptcy of the debtor.[22]\n\n",
            "It is also expected as best practice that the following information be included in section 189A reports:comparison of the estimated dividend under the PIA proposal and bankruptcya list of all creditors and the amount of each debtdetails of the controlling trustee authority, including the relevant dates and its effecta brief financial history of debtor including cause of insolvency.\n\ncomparison of the estimated dividend under the PIA proposal and bankruptcy\n\na list of all creditors and the amount of each debt\n\ndetails of the controlling trustee authority, including the relevant dates and its effect\n\na brief financial history of debtor including cause of insolvency.\n\nFour main cases that provide parameters on what is expected of controlling trustees\u2019 investigations and reports are discussed below.\n\nMcDougall[23]\n\nInMcDougall, the controlling trustee identified the existence of a family trust, set out a number of the trust\u2019s activities and made it clear in the report that, in the event of bankruptcy, the trustee would most likely have access to trust assets, pursuant to section 139D of the Bankruptcy Act.\n\nThe controlling trustee\u2019s report recited the debtor\u2019s description of how his financial difficulties had arisen and his explanation of the circumstances in which specific debts disclosed by his statement of affairs had been incurred. \u00a0The report noted that the debtor had no immediate prospects of being able to pay his debts and had therefore submitted a proposal for consideration by his creditors. \u00a0The report recommended that creditors not accept the proposal.\n\nThe primary judge, Goldberg J, examined whether the trustee\u2019s report set out sufficient information. \u00a0It was submitted by the applicant that:the report showed that the Trustee had not made enquiries in relation to the Debtor\u2019s family trust.\n\nGoldberg J\u2019s conclusions, however, were as follows:It is apparent from the report that the Trustee had identified the existence of the family trust company and the report set out a number of its activities and affairs. \u00a0Further, the Trustee made it clear in paragraph 19 of the report that in the event of bankruptcy of the Debtor, the Trustee \u201cwould most likely have access to the assets of The Stuart McDougall Family Trust pursuant to provisions of Section 139D of the Act\u201d. \u00a0I therefore reject the submission that the report shows that the Trustee had not made all necessary enquiries in relation to the Trust within the time available to him. \u00a0In any event, upon the proper construction of s 189A(2)(b) the Trustee was only obliged to set out such information relevant to the affairs of the Debtor as was available to him. \u00a0His only obligation to set out such information as was necessary to give a true and fair view of the Debtor\u2019s affairs was if that information was, in fact, available to him.\n\nWhen the matter went to appeal on other grounds Ryan, Whitlam and Marshall JJ went on to highlight and confirm comments made in an earlier decision:[24]A controlling trustee has marked advantages over the general body of creditors. \u00a0His position as controlling trustee gives him access to the business and financial records of the debtor (s 189(1)). \u00a0The debtor is required to furnish him with such information with respect to any of the debtor's examinable affairs as the controlling trustee requires, and to comply with any directions given to him by the controlling trustee (s 189(2))....\u2026The controlling trustee may, with the consent in writing of the debtor, obtain such advice or assistance as he thinks necessary (see s 190(5A)).\u2026The controlling trustee can explore the possibility that there may be antecedent transactions by the debtor which may be set aside, to the benefit of the creditors, in the course of the administration of his estate, if an order of sequestration were made.\n\nMcDougallthen is a useful guide, particularly where companies and trusts are involved, supporting the view that enquiry is necessary to ascertain and report on their activity, their worth, the debtor\u2019s involvement and major transactions involving the debtor; in order to allow the trustee to comment on the effect of bankruptcy, particularly in respect to section 139D of the Bankruptcy Act, possible deeming of income and contributions, and possible voidable transactions.\n\n",
            "Messina[25]\n\nInMessina,Goldberg J (who also was the primary judge inMcDougall) had to firstly decide whether a creditor was entitled to vote at the meeting. \u00a0He decided that the creditor, a related entity, was not a creditor and not entitled to vote. \u00a0He was then asked to decide whether the controlling trustee had failed in his duty by admitting the creditor to vote purportedly without adequately investigating the debt. \u00a0Goldberg J stated:... Although the trustee made a number of mistakes in relation to the work he undertook, I am satisfied that the information supplied to Mr Burridge and the trustee and the circumstances surrounding that information was such that the trustee did not act in breach of such duty as was imposed on him by s 190(2)(b) of the Act to make enquiries and investigations in connection with the debtor's property and examinable affairs ...... It must be remembered that the trustee has a limited time within which to make the enquiries and carry out the investigations as the creditors' meeting must be held not later than 35 days after the authority is signed by the debtor: s 194(1)(a) of the Act.The trustee does not have the time, and is not under an obligation, to undertake an audit of the debtor\u2019s affairs. \u00a0As Olney J said in Re Horne; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Horne and Pratt* (supra):\u201cWhat is clear is that the legislation does not require the controlling trustee to audit the debtor's statement of affairs and to certify to the creditors the correctness or otherwise of the statement. \u00a0His power to inquire and investigate is limited to matters he considers necessary. \u00a0In every case it will be for the controlling trustee consistent with his duty to the creditors to determine what inquiries and investigations are necessary. \u00a0The trustee's ultimate function is to ensure that he can express the opinion required by s 189A(3) with such a degree of authority that the creditors can confidently act upon the opinion if they so desire.\u201d*Re Horne; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Horne and Pratt (unreported, 10 May 1996)\n\nThe controlling trustee made enquiries of the debtor and his accountant, who was also the accountant for the family company claiming to be a creditor, asked for evidence from the accountant and prior to the meeting saw a company balance sheet. \u00a0The Court thought this to be sufficient enquiry into those particular issues and appropriate reporting.\n\nMoustafa[26]\n\nInMoustafa, Marshall J outlined the powers and responsibilities of a controlling trustee. \u00a0This case puts the Court\u2019s views quite firmly in relation to what is expected of a controlling trustee\u2019s report:The purpose of the controlling trustee\u2019s report is to fully apprise the creditors as to the debtor\u2019s affairs so that the creditors can make an informed decision on whether their best interests would be served by accepting the debtor\u2019s proposal or by bankruptcy of the debtor. \u00a0It is essential for the controlling trustee to ensure that all facts material to the debtor\u2019s affairs are brought to the attention of the creditors in the report and that the statement of belief of the controlling trustee is properly based.\n\nWong[27]\n\nAs a result of repeated errors identified by AFSA Enforcement and Practitioner Surveillance across a range of personal insolvency matters (including the failure to adequately investigate and report on debtor\u2019s affairs in section 189A reports), the Inspector-General convened a disciplinary committee[28]to consider Mr Luke Ching Wong\u2019s continued registration as a trustee.\n\nBy Committee Report dated 5 September 2006, it was decided that Mr Wong should cease to be registered as a trustee under the Bankruptcy Act.\n\nMr Wong appealed the committee\u2019s decision to the Administrative Review Tribunal (\u201cthe ART\u201d) where it was argued, on behalf of Mr Wong, that as controlling trustee under Part X, there was limited time and ability to make full enquiries.\n\nIn upholding the committee decision that Mr Wong be deregistered, Mr B H Pascoe, Senior Member of the ART, stated at [12]:It is accepted that a trustee under the Act has an onerous duty. \u00a0Particularly in Part X arrangements, the trustee has limited time and limited coercive powers. \u00a0However as stated in Muir v Bradley (1984) 57 ALR 155:\u201ca trustee in bankruptcy is a person who must command and retain the confidence of the court, of the creditors and debtors in bankruptcy proceedings and of the general community. \u00a0His competence must be, and remain, of a high order.\u201d\n\n",

            "Fiduciary duties principlesThe provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, Bankruptcy Regulations and Rules relating to trustees\u2019 duties are supplemented by the common law duties of a trustee, which are well established. \u00a0Several important bankruptcy cases and the principles that can be drawn from them are worth noting.Adsett v Berlouis[29]The findings of Northrop J inAdsett v Berlouis,while relating to the conduct of a registered trustee, has some aspects which have some bearing on controlling trustees. \u00a0The particular principles that can be drawn from this case are:1.A trustee is bound to administer that estate in accordance with the Bankruptcy Act and the Rules.2.A trustee has a dual function: first, to administer the estate in the interests of the creditors and the bankrupt; second, to exercise, as a public duty and for the public welfare, certain powers given, and duties imposed, by the Bankruptcy Act.3.A trustee in bankruptcy who acts for remuneration is under a duty of care greater than that of a gratuitous trustee.4.The trustee is required to bring reasonable skill to the performance of their duties.Alafaci[30]InAlafaci, Riley J stated (at page 285):In order for a trustee to be removed and make good the losses it must be established that the Trustee has been guilty of a breach of duty to act diligently and prudently in regard to the business of the Trust.This decision illustrates the following principle:5.A trustee is required to act with reasonable prudence and diligence and is required to safeguard trust property.Moustafa[31]In Moustafa, Marshall J outlined the powers and responsibilities of a controlling trustee:\u2026it is a fundamental duty of a controlling trustee to act in an impartial and independent manner. \u00a0Anything else would undermine public confidence in the administration of a Part X arrangement... \u00a0The controlling trustee must be impartial to the wishes of the debtor. \u00a0In this respect, the role or function of the controlling trustee is the same regardless of whether the controlling trustee is a solicitor or registered trustee.Principles from the Moustafa case are that:6.A controlling trustee must act in an impartial and independent manner and be impartial to the wishes of the debtor.7.The controlling trustee is charged with the function of ruling on any entitlement of any person to vote at a meeting of creditors (see Division 75 and subsection 75-100(1) of the Rules). \u00a0A controlling trustee must discharge this function with propriety having regard to the merits of a creditor\u2019s claim and without regard to extraneous considerations.Principles 6 and 7 above are confirmed by subsection 75-100(2) of the Rules.\n\nThe provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, Bankruptcy Regulations and Rules relating to trustees\u2019 duties are supplemented by the common law duties of a trustee, which are well established. \u00a0Several important bankruptcy cases and the principles that can be drawn from them are worth noting.\n\nAdsett v Berlouis[29]\n\nThe findings of Northrop J inAdsett v Berlouis,while relating to the conduct of a registered trustee, has some aspects which have some bearing on controlling trustees. \u00a0The particular principles that can be drawn from this case are:1.A trustee is bound to administer that estate in accordance with the Bankruptcy Act and the Rules.2.A trustee has a dual function: first, to administer the estate in the interests of the creditors and the bankrupt; second, to exercise, as a public duty and for the public welfare, certain powers given, and duties imposed, by the Bankruptcy Act.3.A trustee in bankruptcy who acts for remuneration is under a duty of care greater than that of a gratuitous trustee.4.The trustee is required to bring reasonable skill to the performance of their duties.\n\nAlafaci[30]\n\nInAlafaci, Riley J stated (at page 285):In order for a trustee to be removed and make good the losses it must be established that the Trustee has been guilty of a breach of duty to act diligently and prudently in regard to the business of the Trust.\n\n",

inspection of bankruptcy trustees and debt agreement administrators. \u00a0This includes reviewing documentation filed by the controlling trustee before the meeting as well as attending meetings when considered appropriate (or requested to by a relevant stakeholder).Common errors identified by AFSA in the course of its proactive monitoring and meeting attendances are listed below to provide guidance to controlling trustees.Failure to refer offencesControlling trustees are reminded of their duties in paragraphs 190A(1)(d) and (e) of the Bankruptcy Act to consider whether the debtor has committed an offence against the Bankruptcy Act and, if so, to refer the appropriate evidence to AFSA or the relevant law enforcement authorities.Not giving effect to the authorityThere have been occasions where a debtor has not given the controlling trustee a statement of affairs and/or a proposal before the controlling trustee consents to exercise the power under the authority. \u00a0As a result, the controlling trustee authority is ineffective, pursuant to subsection 188(2C) of the Bankruptcy Act. \u00a0This invalidates the controlling trusteeship and, by implication, any resolutions passed at the meeting and any subsequent actions taken.Where an ineffective authority is identified prior to the meeting being held, or if the meeting is held prior to the PIA being signed, the debtor and creditors should be advised and the process started again. \u00a0In these circumstances, the debtor would not be prevented from signing another authority for 6 months in accordance with subsection 188(4) of the Bankruptcy Act. \u00a0Where an ineffective authority is identified after the PIA is signed, the PIA trustee would need to seek legal advice and take steps which may involve applying to the Court for approval or directions.The costs associated with the ineffective authority, including the controlling trustee's and PIA trustee\u2019s costs and remuneration together with any Court costs, cannot be charged to the administration. \u00a0This demonstrates the importance of ensuring that the debtor completes a statement of affairs and draft proposal prior to the controlling trustee signing a section 188 authority.Not holding the meeting within 30 business days of the authority becoming effectiveOn occasion, controlling trustees have either convened or held the meeting outside the required period from when the authority became effective. \u00a0This may invalidate any resolutions passed at the meeting and necessitates the controlling trustee making application to the Court for approval for an extension of the relevant period. \u00a0The costs associated with the application to Court and the further meeting to begin the process again to rectify this error are not to be charged to the estate.Inadequate investigations leading to incomplete reportsOn occasion, controlling trustees have sent section 189A reports to creditors that did not contain a complete picture of all material matters concerning the debtor\u2019s affairs. \u00a0These matters, amongst other things, normally concern:property not disclosed by the debtor on their statement of affairs, where independent asset searches undertaken by the controlling trustee that would have identified this propertyincome incorrectly disclosed by the debtor on their statement of affairs, where obtaining the most recent payslip would have verified the true income of the debtorantecedent transactions not investigated.The result of an incomplete section 189A report is that creditors are not able to make an informed decision as to the debtor\u2019s PIA proposal. \u00a0In these cases, AFSA will request the controlling trustee to provide a supplementary 189A report to bring creditors fully up to date at no further cost to the administration. \u00a0It is likely this will also necessitate the adjourning of the meeting, again at no further cost to the administration.Controlling trustees are also reminded of their duty pursuant to paragraph 189A(1)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act to state whether they believe that the creditors\u2019 interests would be better served by accepting the debtor's draft PIA proposal or by the bankruptcy of the debtor. \u00a0It is expected that this belief is stated without qualification.Determining voting entitlements at the meetingIt is important that the voting entitlements of various creditors, particularly related parties\u2019 claims, are investigated as much as possible before making a final determination as to the validity of the claim. \u00a0Where sufficient doubt exists as to a claim\u2019s validity, the determination of which could influence the outcome of the PIA proposal, consideration can be given to adjourning the meeting to give the controlling trustee sufficient time to further investigate the merits of the claim.Not obtaining consent of the PIA trustee before the meetingIn accordance with section 215A of the Bankruptcy Act, the controlling trustee needs to ensure that the consent of the proposed incoming PIA trustee is obtained prior to the meeting. \u00a0This provision renders the resolution to nominate the PIA trustee void unless consent is given prior to the meeting. \u00a0However, where the appropriate consent is not obtained:the Court may, on application of the nominated person(s) or interested party, declare the resolution to nominate the PIA trustee not to be void (subsection 215A(2) of the Bankruptcy Act)pursuant to subsection 306(2) of the Bankruptcy Act, any act done by the PIA trustee in good faith is not invalidated by reason of this \u201cirregularity\u201d.[40]\n\n",

As part of this approach, we have also tiered practitioners to allow us to better determine the level of supervisory attention that needs to be given.Compliance Information Request (\u201cCIR\u201d)Each year AFSA publishes acompliance programthat sets out our key focus areas. \u00a0These are also identified following an evaluation of information and data available to AFSA, as well as through environmental scanning and close engagement with stakeholders and the profession.The compliance approach occurs through our various business-as-usual activities or through targeted CIRs. \u00a0In deciding which approach is most appropriate, we consider:outcomes and any recommendations from key focus areas undertaken in previous yearsrisk factors for non-compliance by practitioners in key focus areasdesired outcomes from a targeted approach to the key focus areashow best to minimise the regulatory burden on practitioners.A CIR is a targeted written request for information. \u00a0It may also be referred to as a targeted inspection and through this activity, we may require practitioners to provide information about their compliance with the Bankruptcy Act.In determining the sample of administrations or practitioners, we use a mix of random selection and targeted sampling through analysis of data held by AFSA.CIR inspections are different to traditional inspections, with specific requirements and do not generally require practitioners to provide full administration records. \u00a0Depending on the outcome, each of these may lead to a full inspection.Fraud control issuesAn important benefit of this program is that, while an inspection of a sample of administrations cannot be expected to identify all compliance issues, it is a valid preventative control to minimise the risk of fraud.We have built into our inspection program tests of the systems and controls of practitioners. \u00a0The following aspects of the inspection program should be noted:The administration sample is selected on the basis of risk and types of estates. \u00a0At least one administration is randomly selected.The random sample can include estates where no property was shown as realised and no money recorded and could include estates where there may have been deliberate omissions.Estates with property, contributions or dividends are closely examined and the transactions followed through the course of the administration to final payments/dividend. \u00a0This may well include tracing a series of cheques to the accounts to which they are presented.On a sample basis, contributions may be reconciled with the bankrupt\u2019s payment records.We may contact both creditors and bankrupts/debtors on a sample basis (and in some cases may contact banking institutions) to verify transactions and that claims are properly recorded and authentic.Practitioners will be required to reconstruct any files unable to be located and we will treat the inability to do so within a reasonable time frame as a serious breach of duty.As an added deterrent to possible employee fraud it is the Inspector-General\u2019s expectation that practitioners will inform their employees of these aspects of the inspection program.Arranging the inspectionAFSA aims to provide practitioners with at least 7 days\u2019 notice of the date of its attendance for inspection. \u00a0A mutually convenient date and time to inspect will be coordinated with the practitioner. \u00a0At this time, the practitioner will be asked to complete and provide documents evidencing their systems and controls or an update of changes since the last inspection.As a control to minimise the risk of fraud, we will provide 24 hours\u2019 notice of an inspection. \u00a0If we identify older files that may be archived, 48 hours\u2019 notice will be provided to allow for file retrieval.This practice is used with all practitioners including the Official Trustee. \u00a0AFSA has previously identified fraud where the provision of a longer notice period provided a trustee\u2019s employee the time to remove, alter and forge records prior to the inspection.AFSA is required to comply with workplace health and safety legislation in providing its employees with a healthy and safe work environment. \u00a0With this in mind and to ensure both privacy and efficiency in undertaking inspections, practitioners are requested to provide an office with a workstation and office chair or a workstation and office chair with access to a power point and some level of privacy.Determining the scope of the inspectionAFSA generally inspect a standard number of administrations to ensure a minimum number of administrations are included in the sample size.An evaluation is undertaken of a practitioner\u2019s systems and controls during the first inspection or after obtaining this information from the practitioner via a questionnaire, and details are maintained as part of the practitioner risk profile.\u00a0 This is updated as new data is made available and specifically after each inspection. \u00a0This data will form part of information used to select the areas to examine during an inspection.The second element of the sampling is the targeted selection of the files to inspect. \u00a0Our methodology is based on a number of risk attributes. \u00a0For example, attributes in a Part X personal insolvency agreement or a Part IV bankruptcy might include:estates where the extent of assets realised is greater than a certain amountestates where the percentage of remuneration is greater than a certain amountestates where dividends have been paidestates with high amounts of liabilitiesPart X administrations with a low percentage dividend.While the Part IX sample is largely random in nature, some attributes may be examined. \u00a0For example, administrations may be selected where:the debt agreement proposal (\u201cDAP\u201d) has been rejected or cancelled by the Official Receivervariations and terminations in the first 6-12 months have occurredthe fees charged are outside the normal range.It should be noted that, in relation to the administrations that are randomly selected for inspection, these may display no identifiable attributes and may include administrations previously examined.Undertaking the inspectionThe inspection commences with an entrance interview with the registered practitioner. \u00a0This interview is an opportunity for the practitioner to discuss matters or technical areas of interest with the AFSA inspector, particularly if there is an area where the practitioner seeks additional feedback. \u00a0The practitioner\u2019s response and documents provided from the systems and controls questionnaire will also be discussed at the entrance interview. \u00a0It is important that the practitioner is present at this interview (video conference or face to face).It is preferable that queries identified during the inspection be informally discussed and, where possible, clarified with the practitioners or their nominee during the inspection. \u00a0To minimise any disruption to workflow, the practitioner should outline the protocols they require of our staff, including which inspectors can be contacted for clarification of issues during the inspection. \u00a0If the practitioner feels that this may be too disruptive, arrangements can be made to collate queries for discussion at the exit interview or for response at a later time.Our inspectors are required to maintain a professional, independent and courteous approach. \u00a0If during the inspection a practitioner is concerned about the conduct of the officer or the inspection process they should raise these concerns directly either with the AFSA officer, the Director Practitioner Surveillance or the National Manager Enforcement and Practitioner Surveillance.If a possible error is found (see reporting non-compliance below) further testing may be carried out to determine whether the error is a one-off occurrence, a systemic problem or if it identifies a weakness in supervision or training.We will inspect each selected estate or administration for compliance. \u00a0We will then analyse and compile the results to assess whether there are systemic issues or control weaknesses.The inspection will be completed by an exit interview. \u00a0Feedback will be given about the quality of the administrations inspected. \u00a0Any preliminary errors and/or observations noted and discussed throughout the inspection will be raised at the exit interview and the practitioner will be given the opportunity to comment. \u00a0We will also provide comments about any issues identified by the practitioner at the entrance interview as well as any issues of best practice where greater efficiencies could be achieved.Records are made and retained of discussions and comments made both at the entrance and exit interviews.Reporting non-complianceIn providing feedback and to make overall conclusions about the standard of practice, any identified areas of non-compliance (referred to as errors) are compiled and reported.\u00a0 Errors are classified by the level of seriousness (the category) and by a descriptor e.g. conflict of interest.If any breach or non-compliance with the law is identified, we will consider when determining the category of error:the nature and circumstances of the breachthe seriousness of the effect of a failure to comply, including the impact on a particular estate or individualthe relevant prior conduct of the practitioner.The majority of practitioners are willing to comply and view the inspection program as an opportunity to obtain feedback about the quality of their administrations. \u00a0However, there is an expectation that practitioners who regularly fail to comply with the Bankruptcy Act and Regulations without a reasonable explanation, who regularly diverge from acceptable practice or whose behaviour/conduct brings the integrity of the profession into disrepute, will be subject to disciplinary action.To assist in assessing the seriousness and relevant regulatory response and to alert practitioners of the issues and possible repercussions, non-compliances are classified as category A, B or C depending on the level of seriousness.Category AThese are very serious errors or breaches requiring immediate attention and include fundamental breaches and lack of controls that are likely to bring into question the integrity of the system.\u00a0 These include any repeat occurrences of serious breaches identified in previous inspections as category B errors.\u00a0 These matters will generally give rise to legal action, referral to fraud investigators, consideration about whether the practitioner should have their registration cancelled under Division 40 of the Insolvency Practice Schedule, sections 186K or 186L of the Bankruptcy Act or at least have their registration suspended or conditions placed on it.\u00a0 In the case of a solicitor controlling trustee, this would result in action which could result in that person being declared ineligible to act.Category BThese are serious or systemic errors that will have a material impact on the administration and require timely remedial action.\u00a0 The practitioner should be counselled and timely remedial action taken.\u00a0 These include where in prior inspections breaches were identified and either not remedied or repeated errors are made in the same area.Category CThese are one-off practice or procedural errors and non-compliance errors that are not systemic or don\u2019t have a significant impact on the administration, dividends, creditors, debtors\u2019 rights or system integrity but should be brought to the attention of the practitioner and monitored.Finalising the inspectionAfter undertaking the inspection (on site or remotely), inspectors may write to a sample of creditors in administrations identified during the inspection where the practitioner\u2019s records show a dividend has been paid to creditors. \u00a0This verification is to ensure that the creditors are bona fide and that they received and banked dividend cheques or payments. \u00a0Inspectors may also sample and seek verification from debtors about the amount paid.Once our analysis and review is complete the practitioner will be provided with an initial inspection report seeking comments about any identified issues. \u00a0The report will outline the overall results of the inspection, any provisional errors or systemic issues or observations of significance as discussed either at or after the exit interview, and any remedial action that may be required. \u00a0In cases where serious or systemic issues appear to have been identified, the report will be reviewed and issued by the responsible Director.The practitioner\u2019s response is generally expected within 14 days. \u00a0The inspection report is finalised once the practitioner responds to the inspection report or elects to not respond.\u00a0 The response will be taken into account in determining the final errors or observations to be made in the final report.\u00a0 This report is then issued to the practitioner to finalise the inspection. \u00a0This report may require certain remedial action to be undertaken.The practitioner\u2019s risk profile is then updated and AFSA will monitor any specific administrations requiring remedial action.The Inspector-General is bound by the Privacy Act 1988 and will maintain the confidentiality of individual inspection results unless Privacy Act exceptions apply. \u00a0Exceptions allowed for under privacy legislation or where AFSA is able to provide specific details to others include:where there has been consent by the practitionerinformation required by a law enforcement agencywhere the information has become public knowledge, for example through publishing of a Court or Administrative Review Tribunal judgment.Possible actions when breaches are identifiedThere are a range of options available to AFSA if a breach of legislation or duty or other non-compliance has occurred. \u00a0These options relate to all practitioners and include:individual feedback \u2013 by far the most effective means to achieve timely remedial actionguidance \u2013 making

As part of this approach, we have also tiered practitioners to allow us to better determine the level of supervisory attention that needs to be given.\n\nCompliance Information Request (\u201cCIR\u201d)\n\nEach year AFSA publishes acompliance programthat sets out our key focus areas. \u00a0These are also identified following an evaluation of information and data available to AFSA, as well as through environmental scanning and close engagement with stakeholders and the profession.\n\nThe compliance approach occurs through our various business-as-usual activities or through targeted CIRs. \u00a0In deciding which approach is most appropriate, we consider:outcomes and any recommendations from key focus areas undertaken in previous yearsrisk factors for non-compliance by practitioners in key focus areasdesired outcomes from a targeted approach to the key focus areashow best to minimise the regulatory burden on practitioners.\n\noutcomes and any recommendations from key focus areas undertaken in previous years\n\nrisk factors for non-compliance by practitioners in key focus areas\n\ndesired outcomes from a targeted approach to the key focus areas\n\nhow best to minimise the regulatory burden on practitioners.\n\nA CIR is a targeted written request for information. \u00a0It may also be referred to as a targeted inspection and through this activity, we may require practitioners to provide information about their compliance with the Bankruptcy Act.\n\nIn determining the sample of administrations or practitioners, we use a mix of random selection and targeted sampling through analysis of data held by AFSA.\n\nCIR inspections are different to traditional inspections, with specific requirements and do not generally require practitioners to provide full administration records. \u00a0Depending on the outcome, each of these may lead to a full inspection.\n\nFraud control issues\n\nAn important benefit of this program is that, while an inspection of a sample of administrations cannot be expected to identify all compliance issues, it is a valid preventative control to minimise the risk of fraud.\n\nWe have built into our inspection program tests of the systems and controls of practitioners. \u00a0The following aspects of the inspection program should be noted:The administration sample is selected on the basis of risk and types of estates. \u00a0At least one administration is randomly selected.The random sample can include estates where no property was shown as realised and no money recorded and could include estates where there may have been deliberate omissions.Estates with property, contributions or dividends are closely examined and the transactions followed through the course of the administration to final payments/dividend. \u00a0This may well include tracing a series of cheques to the accounts to which they are presented.On a sample basis, contributions may be reconciled with the bankrupt\u2019s payment records.We may contact both creditors and bankrupts/debtors on a sample basis (and in some cases may contact banking institutions) to verify transactions and that claims are properly recorded and authentic.Practitioners will be required to reconstruct any files unable to be located and we will treat the inability to do so within a reasonable time frame as a serious breach of duty.\n\n",

proposals.Attendance at a sample of meetings provides AFSA with an opportunity to monitor and report on the standard of controlling trustees in Part X administrations and trustee meeting practices. \u00a0It also provides an effective and efficient method of monitoring debtors\u2019 Part X and section 73 proposals and addressing creditor queries and concerns.In addition, we examine reports sent to creditors under section 189A of the Bankruptcy Act and section 75-175 of theInsolvency Practice Rules (Bankruptcy) 2016. \u00a0If any queries or concerns are identified, we will discuss matters with the trustee and may attend the meeting, taking an active role if needed. \u00a0Often issues are clarified or problem areas rectified before creditors are asked to vote at the meeting.The following information documents the criteria that we use in determining which creditors\u2019 meetings are attended and the protocols and processes to be used.The term \u201ctrustee\u201d is used in this practice document to represent registered trustees, the Official Trustee and solicitor controlling trustees.The legislative frameworkSection 75-30 of the Insolvency Practice Schedule provides authority for the Inspector-General to attend and participate in meetings of creditors. \u00a0This section states:(1) The Inspector-General is entitled to attend any meeting of creditors held under this Act(2)\u00a0 Subject to any provision of this Act (including any provision in relation to voting),the Inspector-General is entitled to participate in any meeting of creditors held under this Act.Criteria for attending: generalAFSA may attend meetings where there appears to be an inherent risk to the credibility of the personal insolvency system posed by the administration for which the meeting is being held. \u00a0This would be the case where:it is suspected that creditors have not been properly informed, either because the debtor has not provided complete or accurate information or the trustee\u2019s report is deficientthe debtor is high profile with sizeable debts and there is public interest in the matterAFSA has concerns about the validity of a creditor\u2019s claim and the creditor can affect the outcome of the meetingAFSA has concerns about the independence of the controlling trustee or trustee or suspected involvement of an untrustworthy pre-insolvency advisor.Criteria for attending: trustee-specificMeetings may also be attended when:the trustee has a history of poor-quality reports and meeting practicesthe trustee is inexperienced or does not regularly conduct meetings of creditorsthe bankrupt\u2019s/debtor\u2019s statement of affairs[1]or information from some other source indicates:the debtor may have been involved in a high income occupation such as doctor or barrister, but displays little in the way of assets or income, and the offer to creditors is relatively smallantecedent transactionsthe debtor may have recently possessed substantial income, assets or they control trusts or private companies,and the trustee has been requested to provide further advice but a satisfactory response has not been provided and/or the section 189A report or report on the section 73 proposal contains no or inadequate discussion of those issuesCriteria for attending: creditor-specificMeetings may also be attended when:a creditor lodges a complaint before the meetingthere are related-party creditors whose vote can affect the outcome or there is a high number of creditors who may vote but don\u2019t wish to participate in a dividend, particularly where there is a substantial creditor likely to be affected.a creditor requests AFSA to attend the meeting of creditors and the reasons based on our preliminary assessment appear to be valida creditor of the estate may also be a pre-insolvency advisor and there may be a threat to independence of the controlling trustee or trusteea creditor has raised concerns about the conduct of the controlling trustee or trustee relating to meetings of creditorsone or more creditors\u2019 claims are significant and disputed.Criteria for attending: debtor-specificMeetings may also be attended when:the debtor has been bankrupt or entered into a Part IX or Part X twice or more in the 10 years preceding the current section 188 authoritythe debtor\u2019s creditors exceed $1million and their

be possible to attend all meetings exhibiting one or more of the above criteria. \u00a0In these circumstances we will exercise judgment as to which meetings are attended.Prior to the meetingAFSA will inform the controlling trustee or trustee of the meetings it will be attending prior to these meetings. \u00a0Where possible at least 24 hours\u2019 notice will be given.AFSA may require the controlling trustee or trustee to provide further information or documentation before the meeting, if queries are raised about the content of the report to creditors or statements of claim. \u00a0These requests may include:previous reports to creditors in the mattercopies of the statements of claim filed by creditors and documentary evidence relied upon in adjudicating the claims for the purposes of a meetinginvestigations undertaken in the matter including evidence relating to decisions made.If issues are identified by AFSA, the controlling trustee or trustee may be advised to send a supplementary report to creditors outlining the issues that need to be rectified or explained more thoroughly to allow creditors to make an informed decision. \u00a0The Inspector-General does not consider it appropriate for practitioners to charge for remedial work.We will consider whether the issues identified warrant attendance at the meeting or can be resolved through prior discussion (telephone, email or face to face) and action. \u00a0We will consult with the trustee and raise queries and concerns privately before the meeting if possible. \u00a0Every attempt will be made to resolve these issues before the meeting. \u00a0Intervention may lead to a supplementary report or clarification of contentious issues at meeting.At the meetingUsually two AFSA representatives will attend the meeting although each case will be treated on its merits.Attendance may be in person, video conference or teleconference.Should matters not be addressed to our satisfaction, the inspectors may intervene in meetings, raise issues and seek clarification from the debtor, creditors or the trustee. \u00a0AFSA may intervene in a meeting as considered appropriate and some of these instances may include:addressing procedural deficiencies in relation to the meeting of creditors or to provide guidance to the controlling trustee or trustee as requiredraise issues identified with proxies or statements of claim lodged by creditorsresponding to questions posed towards AFSA staff by anyone at the meeting, if considered appropriate.The attendance of a debtor at a meeting of creditors for a Part X matter is considered to be mandatory \u201cunless prevented by illness or another sufficient cause\u201d. \u00a0The trustee can excuse the debtor from attending if they believe there is a valid reason. \u00a0For a meeting to consider an s73 proposal, it is best practice for the bankrupt to attend the meeting. \u00a0If the bankrupt does not attend the meeting and no valid reason is provided, AFSA will require the trustee to provide an explanation.Confrontational and/or adversarial behaviour by parties at the meeting will not result in any reaction from our staff at the time of the meeting. \u00a0However, where appropriate, feedback will be provided at a later opportunity.If our staff ask questions at the meeting, every effort will be made to provide a list of those questions to the trustee before the meeting. \u00a0The aim is not to ambush the trustee at the meeting although issues may arise that require immediate intervention. \u00a0This would be the case with non-compliance with the law where immediate remedial action is necessary by the trustee.A record will be made of those cases where the trustee or their staff has attempted to hinder our proper involvement at the meeting. \u00a0Consideration will be given after the meeting about whether further action is warranted.Post-meetingAs part of AFSA\u2019s guidance role, where appropriate, feedback will be provided to the trustee on the quality of the meeting processes.AFSA may request a copy of the minutes of the meeting to ensure the required procedures have been followed and all events of the meeting have been accurately recorded.Any specific patterns of inappropriate meeting processes will be recorded and any requirement for remedial action communicated to the trustee.\n\n",

most relevant to and reliant on effective practitioner communication are bankrupts, debtors, creditors andAFSA(representing the Inspector-General and the Official Receiver).Bankrupts/debtorsIn the vast majority of cases, bankrupts and debtors will be new to the insolvency process and will most likely never be subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act again. \u00a0For this reason it is very important that communication is clear and concise.Bankrupts and debtors may be non-responsive for a variety of reasons. \u00a0This represents a significant challenge for the practitioner in ensuring the education of the bankrupt or debtor throughout the insolvency process and outlining the consequences for failing to respond. \u00a0At the same time, the practitioner may need to take action if the bankrupt or debtor delays or does not co-operate. \u00a0The ARITA Code recognises that communicating with bankrupts and others may require firm and forthright communication, particularly in situations where there is a refusal to co-operate, and belligerence, or where examinations or litigation are involved.Practitioners need to also be aware of the rights of bankrupts and debtors to obtain certain information. \u00a0Section 70-56 of the Schedule requires a trustee to comply with a request from a bankrupt or debtor to give them information, provide a report or product a document unless it is not relevant to, or would breach the trustee\u2019s duties in, administering their estate or is otherwise not reasonable. \u00a0A similar provision applies to debt agreement administrators under paragraph 185LA(1)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act.CreditorsLike bankrupts and debtors, creditors (or a committee of inspection) also have rights to obtain certain information. \u00a0Sections 70-40, 70-45 and 80-40 of the Schedule require a trustee to comply with a request from creditors (by resolution), an individual creditor or a committee of inspection, respectively, for information, a report or document unless it:is not relevant to the administration of the estatewould breach the trustee\u2019s duties in relation to the administration of the estateis otherwise not reasonable.Creditors may also be new to the insolvency process and want to achieve an outcome (or receive a dividend) in a shorter time frame than is reasonably practical. \u00a0Again, this represents a challenge for the practitioner in educating creditors and keeping them regularly informed of progress in the administration.Practitioners also need to acknowledge a creditor\u2019s right to have access to books of the administration. \u00a0A trustee must allow a creditor (or their agent) to inspect books of the administration, including those related to carrying on any business, at all reasonable times under paragraphs 70-10(2)(b) and 70-11(1)(b) of the Schedule. \u00a0A trustee who fails to allow access to administration books without reasonable excuse commits an offence of strict liability with a penalty of 5 penalty units.[2]Section 42-130 of the Rules requires a trustee to consider the views of creditors in relation to whether money held by the trustee should be applied to conduct further investigations or be distributed as a dividend. \u00a0As creditors are the ultimate beneficiaries in the estate, their views must be sought by the trustee.CommonwealthThe Commonwealth may request that the trustee provide specified information, reports or documents in relation to the administration of the estate if either:[3]a former employee of the bankrupt/debtor has made a claim from the Commonwealth for financial assistance from the Commonwealth for unpaid employee entitlements, orthe Commonwealth considers that such a claim is likely to be made.The trustee must comply with such a request. \u00a0However, the Commonwealth must bear the cost of providing the information, report or document if the trustee considers that is insufficient property available to comply with the request.[4]Unreasonable requestsThe rights of a bankrupt/debtor or creditor to obtain certain information from a practitioner must be reasonable. \u00a0It isunreasonablefor a trustee to comply with a request from a bankrupt/debtor[5]or creditor(s)[6]for information, a report or document if:(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 it would substantially prejudice the interests of one or more creditors or a third party and that prejudice outweighs the benefits of complying with the request(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 it would be privileged from production in legal proceedings on the ground of legal professional privilege(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 disclosure would found an action by a person for breach of confidence(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 there is not sufficient available property to comply with the request(e)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 it has already been provided(f)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 it is required to be provided under the Act (including Regulations) within 20 business days of the request being made(g)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the request is vexatious.If it is unreasonable to comply with a request for information or a report or document, the trustee must notify the person or body making the request that it is not reasonable, why that is the case and make a written record of this in the books of the administration.[7]It isreasonablefor a trustee to comply with a request for information or a report or document if the factors in (a) to (g) in paragraph 4.11 do not apply. \u00a0Even if factors (d), (e) or (f) apply it is still reasonable for the trustee to comply with such a request if:the bankrupt/debtor or creditor(s) agree to bear the cost of complying with the requestsecurity for the cost is given to the trustee (if required) before the request is complied with.Time to comply with reasonable requestsIf a reasonable request is made for information or a report or document, the trustee must comply within 5 business days after receiving the request or such later period as agreed with the person or body making the request.The trustee may extend the period for complying with the request by giving written notice, if reasonably satisfied that it is required due to the nature of the request.[8]The notice must:be given to the person or body making the requestspecify the period within which the request will be complied with; andspecify the reasons for the extension.[9]Inspector-General direction to comply with reasonable requestsIf a trustee refuses a reasonable request for information or a report or document, the Inspector-General may direct them in writing to give all or part of the relevant material to the person(s) who made the request within 5 business days after the direction is given.[10]Before giving such a direction, the Inspector-General will give the trustee notice in writing:stating that the Inspector-General proposes to give the trustee a directionidentifying all or part of the relevant material and person(s) to whom it is proposed to be giveninviting the trustee to make a written submission within 10 business days after the notice is given stating any objection to the proposed direction the reasons.[11]The Inspector-General will not give a direction to a trustee to give the relevant material if satisfied that the trustee was entitled not to comply with the request by the person under a provision of the Bankruptcy Act (or any other law).[12]Court order to give relevant materialA bankrupt/debtor, creditor or committee of inspection who made the request for information, a report or document may apply to the Court for an order that the trustee give them all or part of the relevant material.[13]The Inspector-General may also apply to the Court for an order that the trustee comply with a direction given to provide information in accordance with paragraph 4.16 above.On application by a bankrupt/debtor, creditor or committee of inspection (subsection 70-90(1) of the Schedule) or the Inspector-General (subsection 70-90(2) of the Schedule), the Court may:order the trustee to give the person(s) who made the request all or part of that materialmake such other orders, including orders as to costs, as it thinks fit.Australian Financial Security Authority (AFSA)It is imperative that practitioners and AFSA keep open lines of communication.The Official Receiver[14]maintains the National Personal Insolvency Index and is reliant on practitioners complying with statutory filing requirements available on theAFSA website. \u00a0This table is a useful tool as it is indexed by stakeholder and legislative requirement as well as detailing the penalties for late lodgment.The Inspector-General monitors the practice standards of practitioners and expects a prompt response to all reasonable requests for information.In return, AFSA must respond to practitioners in a manner consistent with the service standards set out in AFSA\u2019s Client Service Charter.SummaryIt is of paramount importance that all stakeholder groups maintain open and effective communication.Communication problems can often be the result of an expectation gap between what the bankrupt, debtor and creditors think a practitioner should do or has the power to do and what the practitioner does not have the power to do. \u00a0This highlights the importance of clearly defining roles and managing expectations early.It is expected practitioners will, in appropriate circumstances, exercise patience and care and utilise the relevant provisions of the Bankruptcy Act (for example, objections to discharge and section 139ZL notices) to ensure bankrupts, debtors and creditors aid the smooth administration of an estate while also providing guidance and advice as appropriate.The ongoing challenge for practitioners is to balance the competing interests of bankrupts, debtors and creditors by adhering to their duty to act honestly and impartially, as required by the Standards in Division 42 of the Rules.\n\n",

practices in place will greatly assist the achievement of the following goals.Transfer of knowledgeReliable and accurate information is transferred both to and from the practitioner.Knowledge management and educationInformation is readily available for those that reasonably require it.Some practitioners are making information available through password enabled access to their firm\u2019s website. \u00a0Not only does this save time and costs for the administration (e.g. copying and postage) but it also encourages creditors, bankrupts and debtors to become self-sufficient in accessing the answers they need.Promotion of industry best practiceEffective communication allows the Official Receiver to maintain an accurate and up to date National Personal Insolvency Index and to collate important statistical information.It also allows the Inspector-General to monitor the industry in order to identify areas for improvement. \u00a0For example, effective communication practices limit the likelihood of complaints being escalated to the Inspector-General and a practitioner receiving infringement notices such as in cases where documents are filed late with the Official Receiver.Easy to understandEffective communication tailors the message to the reader and avoids the use of jargon, acronyms and overly technical insolvency terms wherever possible.An analysis of practitioner complaints received and investigated by AFSA has revealed that, while many are not justified in terms of a breach of the legislation, many people still feel the need to complain. \u00a0This may often

            "Effective communication can greatly reduce costs and increase returns to creditors. \u00a0Having sound practices in place will greatly assist the achievement of the following goals.\n\nTransfer of knowledge\n\nReliable and accurate information is transferred both to and from the practitioner.\n\nKnowledge management and education\n\nInformation is readily available for those that reasonably require it.\n\nSome practitioners are making information available through password enabled access to their firm\u2019s website. \u00a0Not only does this save time and costs for the administration (e.g. copying and postage) but it also encourages creditors, bankrupts and debtors to become self-sufficient in accessing the answers they need.\n\nPromotion of industry best practice\n\nEffective communication allows the Official Receiver to maintain an accurate and up to date National Personal Insolvency Index and to collate important statistical information.\n\nIt also allows the Inspector-General to monitor the industry in order to identify areas for improvement. \u00a0For example, effective communication practices limit the likelihood of complaints being escalated to the Inspector-General and a practitioner receiving infringement notices such as in cases where documents are filed late with the Official Receiver.\n\nEasy to understand\n\nEffective communication tailors the message to the reader and avoids the use of jargon, acronyms and overly technical insolvency terms wherever possible.\n\nAn analysis of practitioner complaints received and investigated by AFSA has revealed that, while many are not justified in terms of a breach of the legislation, many people still feel the need to complain. \u00a0This may often be because the complainant is being given information either verbally or in writing that is accurate but simply not what they want to hear. \u00a0Nevertheless, it can also be associated with unclear explanations given by the practitioner or a lack of care and patience being afforded in particular to those in financially vulnerable situations.\n\nCommunication mediaPractitioners play a key role in educating bankrupts, debtors and creditors to better understand the insolvency process.Practitioners have the choice of different types of communication mediums, many of which are outlined in section 102 of the Regulations:telephonemailfacsimileteleconferencemeeting or interview (whether formal or informal)emailwebsite, including FAQs, A-Z index material and information kits including fact sheets on the AFSA websiteonline.The communication medium adopted by the practitioner should be in line with the needs of the stakeholder. \u00a0It is reasonable to expect that a practitioner will engage with bankrupts, debtors and creditors using a medium that is convenient and effective. \u00a0For example, an elderly couple with little knowledge of technology may be unlikely to benefit or understand web based or online communication and, should they only wish to receive communication by mail through the post, the practitioner may promote the benefits of electronic communication but if the stakeholder is insistent their wishes will need to be respected.Technology is transforming the way business operates and the pace of change will only increase. \u00a0Technology advances can provide better service delivery, while at the same time improving efficiency and reducing practitioner\u2019s costs. \u00a0Effectively using technology to achieve this goal is a significant challenge.\n\nPractitioners play a key role in educating bankrupts, debtors and creditors to better understand the insolvency process.\n\nPractitioners have the choice of different types of communication mediums, many of which are outlined in section 102 of the Regulations:telephonemailfacsimileteleconferencemeeting or interview (whether formal or informal)emailwebsite, including FAQs, A-Z index material and information kits including fact sheets on the AFSA websiteonline.\n\ntelephone\n\nmail\n\nfacsimile\n\nteleconference\n\nmeeting or interview (whether formal or informal)\n\nemail\n\nwebsite, including FAQs, A-Z index material and information kits including fact sheets on the AFSA website\n\n",

properly taken, or likely to be properly taken, by the trustee in performing the workwhether the trustee has followed the procedure in the Schedule to the Act and the Rules for estimating remuneration, including whether the trustee has adequately described to creditors the work performed or to be performedwhether the trustee has given the regulated debtor and the creditors the notices required to be given under the Rulesand any other relevant matters.Trustees appointed before 1 September 2017:[9]whether the trustee has followed the procedure contained in former section 64U or 64ZBA of the Act for estimating remuneration, including adequately describing to creditors the work performed or to be performedwhether the trustee has given the required notices to the bankrupt and creditors concerning remuneration, required to be given under the Regulations and former regulationswhether the trustee has explained why the work performed or to be performed was or is likely to be necessarywhether, taking into account the nature and complexity of the work, the proposed remuneration is commensurate with:\u2013\u00a0the work already performed, or\u2013\u00a0the work proposed to be performedany other relevant matters.Further information about the factors which may be taken into account by AFSA when deciding the remuneration is available in:Remuneration entitlements of a registered bankruptcy trusteeReviewing remuneration of trustees and costs of third party service providersARITA Code of Professional Practice.The matters considered by AFSA will vary depending on the circumstances under which the application is made. \u00a0For example, if the trustee has satisfied AFSA that it is not cost effective or practical to seek creditors\u2019 approval, it will not be necessary for AFSA to consider whether the trustee has followed the procedure for convening a meeting of creditors or a proposal with a meeting. \u00a0However, it is expected that in such a case the trustee will provide AFSA with the information the trustee would have otherwise been required to provide to the creditors.The reference to \u201cany other relevant matters\u201d in paragraph 60-15(m) of the Rules and the former paragraph 8.11(f) of the former Regulations may include (but is not limited to) some or all of the following:whether the remuneration proposal, if it has been put to creditors for a vote, was rejected and the how the votes were castwhether the trustee has a high rate of rejection of remuneration proposals by either creditors or the Inspector-Generalwhere the proposal has been rejected, whether the trustee attempted to negotiate a lower amount with creditors that they would be willing to accept. \u00a0This may involve seeking approval for a lesser amount than was originally sought.whether sufficient time was given to creditors to vote on the remuneration proposalwhether if a remuneration proposal was sent to creditors without a meeting, there was any follow up with creditors to elicit a responsewhether the amount the trustee is seeking approval for is materially different to the estimate given in the initial remuneration noticefor retrospective approval, whether it is apparent that work has been performed unnecessarily or improperly or that charging is unreasonable.Essentially, AFSA will be concerned to ensure that the trustee has followed the correct procedure in estimating their remuneration and explaining the basis of the estimate, along with the correct procedure for notifying creditors and the bankrupt/debtor of the rates and methods of the proposed remuneration. \u00a0It will not be within AFSA\u2019s remit to consider the reasonableness of the trustee\u2019s hourly (or other time-based) rate, although this may be something that creditors consider when voting on remuneration. \u00a0If a proposal is rejected, the trustee may have to demonstrate to AFSA that they have attempted to negotiate an amount that is acceptable to creditors.Also, AFSA should be satisfied that the proposal includes only the remuneration for work that is likely to be necessary and reasonable and (before deciding to undertake the work) the trustee has compared the cost likely to be incurred with the value and complexity of the administration. \u00a0The trustee\u2019s application to AFSA must explain why the proposed remuneration for the work performed or work yet to be performed is appropriate for the particular administration.It will be open to AFSA to:approve the amount for which the trustee has sought approval, orreject the amount the trustee has sought approval for and either:\u2013\u00a0 substitute a lesser amount than the amount for which the trustee has sought approval, or\u2013\u00a0 make no substitution (with the effect that remuneration remains unapproved).AFSA may seek further information before deciding the application. \u00a0Section 12 of the Bankruptcy Act provides for the making of inquiries and investigations as the Inspector-General thinks fit with respect to the administration of or the conduct of a trustee in relation to (among other things) a bankruptcy, composition, scheme of arrangement, controlling trusteeship or personal insolvency agreement. \u00a0This function will enable AFSA to seek from the trustee any additional information required to decide the trustee\u2019s

            "This practice document applies to all administrators, regardless of the size of their operation.\n\nOverview of duty to keep accounts\n\nAs stated in subsection 185LE(1) of the Bankruptcy Act, an administrator of a debt agreement must keep such accounts, books and records as are necessary to give a full and correct account of the administration of the debt agreement.\n\nWhen required, administrators must also answer any inquiries about the debt agreement and cooperate with any inquiry or investigation made by the Inspector-General (subsections 185LE(1)(c) and (d) of the Bankruptcy Act).\u00a0 Accordingly, an administrator\u2019s books and records must be maintained and presented in such a state to allow for a timely and efficient response to the Inspector-General and to enableAFSAstaff to inspect the records during an inspection (onsite or remotely).\n\nAdministrators must note that their duty to keep and maintain proper accounts, books and records also relates to any work they perform leading up to the voting deadline for acceptance of a debt agreement (section 185LG of the Bankruptcy Act).\u00a0 Since 27 June 2019, the Inspector-General has had the power to review conduct of an administrator from the first point of contact with a debtor, and this power includes the ability to review books and records created from that time.\n\nThe Inspector-General\u2019s expectationsAccounting recordsAdministrators must ensure that accounting records maintained for an administration exhibit a full, correct and informative account of the administration.\u00a0 It is expected that this principle is followed by all administrators in accordance with paragraphs 2.2 to 2.11 below.The administrator will maintain separate records of receipts (paragraph 185LE (a)(i)) and payments (paragraph 185LE(a)(ii)) for each administration.All receipts and payments related to an administration are required to be reflected in the accounts maintained for the administration.\u00a0 Therefore, every transaction for a particular debt agreement that is recorded in the bank statement for the trust bank account must also be recorded in the respective ledger/cash book for the debt agreement to which the transaction relates.All payments from administrations will be verifiable by reference to appropriate supporting vouchers and original documents maintained on the administration file (hardcopy or electronic).\u00a0 Where administrators use one payment for bulk transactions to a particular entity, the records supporting the bulk transaction must adequately identify the individual debt agreements to which the payment relates including the name of the debtor, the amount attributable to each debtor and the date of the payment.\u00a0 This also applies in circumstances where bulk receipts are received.All money received in relation to an administration is to be deposited into the trust bank account and adequately described to enable identification of the transactions.\u00a0 Administrators will need to ensure that sufficient information is given to debtors intending to make electronic deposits so that these transactions are accurate and easily attributable to a particular debt agreement to minimise the risk of unidentified deposits.In circumstances where a particular receipt has been reversed in the bank statement due to the payment being dishonoured, the transactions (deposit and reversal entry) will also need to be reflected in the cash book/ledger for the debt agreement to accurately reflect the transactions that have taken place.Similarly, where a payment has been made and needs to be cancelled if the cheque or money is returned and a replacement payment needs to be made, the cash book/ledger for the debt agreement to which the payment relates is to record the cancellation of the payment in question and the processing of the new payment.Where an error is found and corrected in a ledger/cash book and/or the trust bank account, the identification of the error should be documented as well as the action taken to correct the error to maintain an audit trail detailing how the error was rectified.\u00a0 The file note recording the identification of the error and the action taken should be made on, or attached to, the document in which the error has been found.Journal entries should not be used to correct an error in the ledger/cash book.\u00a0 If an error has been made when recording a receipt or payment in the ledger/cash book, the entry should be reversed and the correct entry made rather than using a journal entry to amend the entry.Statements of receipts and payments forwarded to creditors and/or AFSA shall accurately and meaningfully reflect the financial transactions of the administration.\u00a0 The statements will also need to be logical and easy to read and the creditors and/or AFSA should be able to use the information to quickly determine the current status of the administration.The accounts of the administration must be available for inspection by the Inspector-General (paragraph 185LE(1)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act).\u00a0 Administrators also have a duty to give information about the administration of a debt agreement to the debtor, a creditor or creditor\u2019s authorised representative who makes a reasonable request for that information (paragraphs 185LA(b) and (c)).\u00a0 In appropriate circumstances, this may include providing access to accounts and records of the administration.File maintenanceAdministrators must ensure they aid the efficiency of the administration through the orderly maintenance of administration documents, papers and accounts, to provide an orderly trail for reviewing decision making processes, and to aid the inspection of the administration by the Inspector-General.\u00a0 It is expected that this principle is followed by all administrators in accordance with paragraphs 2.13 to 2.18 below.Separate files should be maintained for each administration (hardcopy or electronic).A record is to be maintained as part of the administration file of every significant step (including important conversations) in the administration of a matter.Administration files and records are to be maintained in a secure location to ensure authorised access only.Where electronic storage is used as part of the administration process, the administrator will need to ensure that there is adequate security as to access and adequate supporting documentation to verify any changes to the electronically stored material.\u00a0 Adequate data backup procedures and contingency plans should also be documented and in place.The administrator must be able to produce all records relating to the administration in such a manner that the processes of the administration, including decisions made, actions taken and accounts maintained for the administration, are readily traceable and verifiable.To comply with the Privacy Act 1988, personal information obtained during the course of the administration is not to be disclosed to third parties unless the disclosure is required by law or authorised by the person to whom the personal information relates.\u201cMinimum information\u201dThe \u201cminimum information\u201d that administrators will need to be able to provide to the Inspector-General at any time must consist of the

            "Accounting records\n\nAdministrators must ensure that accounting records maintained for an administration exhibit a full, correct and informative account of the administration.\u00a0 It is expected that this principle is followed by all administrators in accordance with paragraphs 2.2 to 2.11 below.\n\nThe administrator will maintain separate records of receipts (paragraph 185LE (a)(i)) and payments (paragraph 185LE(a)(ii)) for each administration.\n\nAll receipts and payments related to an administration are required to be reflected in the accounts maintained for the administration.\u00a0 Therefore, every transaction for a particular debt agreement that is recorded in the bank statement for the trust bank account must also be recorded in the respective ledger/cash book for the debt agreement to which the transaction relates.\n\nAll payments from administrations will be verifiable by reference to appropriate supporting vouchers and original documents maintained on the administration file (hardcopy or electronic).\u00a0 Where administrators use one payment for bulk transactions to a particular entity, the records supporting the bulk transaction must adequately identify the individual debt agreements to which the payment relates including the name of the debtor, the amount attributable to each debtor and the date of the payment.\u00a0 This also applies in circumstances where bulk receipts are received.\n\nAll money received in relation to an administration is to be deposited into the trust bank account and adequately described to enable identification of the transactions.\u00a0 Administrators will need to ensure that sufficient information is given to debtors intending to make electronic deposits so that these transactions are accurate and easily attributable to a particular debt agreement to minimise the risk of unidentified deposits.\n\nIn circumstances where a particular receipt has been reversed in the bank statement due to the payment being dishonoured, the transactions (deposit and reversal entry) will also need to be reflected in the cash book/ledger for the debt agreement to accurately reflect the transactions that have taken place.\n\nSimilarly, where a payment has been made and needs to be cancelled if the cheque or money is returned and a replacement payment needs to be made, the cash book/ledger for the debt agreement to which the payment relates is to record the cancellation of the payment in question and the processing of the new payment.\n\nWhere an error is found and corrected in a ledger/cash book and/or the trust bank account, the identification of the error should be documented as well as the action taken to correct the error to maintain an audit trail detailing how the error was rectified.\u00a0 The file note recording the identification of the error and the action taken should be made on, or attached to, the document in which the error has been found.\n\nJournal entries should not be used to correct an error in the ledger/cash book.\u00a0 If an error has been made when recording a receipt or payment in the ledger/cash book, the entry should be reversed and the correct entry made rather than using a journal entry to amend the entry.\n\nStatements of receipts and payments forwarded to creditors and/or AFSA shall accurately and meaningfully reflect the financial transactions of the administration.\u00a0 The statements will also need to be logical and easy to read and the creditors and/or AFSA should be able to use the information to quickly determine the current status of the administration.\n\nThe accounts of the administration must be available for inspection by the Inspector-General (paragraph 185LE(1)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act).\u00a0 Administrators also have a duty to give information about the administration of a debt agreement to the debtor, a creditor or creditor\u2019s authorised representative who makes a reasonable request for that information (paragraphs 185LA(b) and (c)).\u00a0 In appropriate circumstances, this may include providing access to accounts and records of the administration.\n\n",
            "File maintenance\n\nAdministrators must ensure they aid the efficiency of the administration through the orderly maintenance of administration documents, papers and accounts, to provide an orderly trail for reviewing decision making processes, and to aid the inspection of the administration by the Inspector-General.\u00a0 It is expected that this principle is followed by all administrators in accordance with paragraphs 2.13 to 2.18 below.\n\nSeparate files should be maintained for each administration (hardcopy or electronic).\n\nA record is to be maintained as part of the administration file of every significant step (including important conversations) in the administration of a matter.\n\nAdministration files and records are to be maintained in a secure location to ensure authorised access only.\n\nWhere electronic storage is used as part of the administration process, the administrator will need to ensure that there is adequate security as to access and adequate supporting documentation to verify any changes to the electronically stored material.\u00a0 Adequate data backup procedures and contingency plans should also be documented and in place.\n\nThe administrator must be able to produce all records relating to the administration in such a manner that the processes of the administration, including decisions made, actions taken and accounts maintained for the administration, are readily traceable and verifiable.\n\nTo comply with the Privacy Act 1988, personal information obtained during the course of the administration is not to be disclosed to third parties unless the disclosure is required by law or authorised by the person to whom the personal information relates.\n\n\u201cMinimum information\u201d\n\nThe \u201cminimum information\u201d that administrators will need to be able to provide to the Inspector-General at any time must consist of the following.Individual cashbook and/or debtor\u2019s ledger for each debt agreement.

            "IntroductionThe purpose of this practice direction is to outline the position of the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy in regard to the principles on which a private registered trustee in bankruptcy is entitled to draw remuneration, the different methods available and what constitutes reasonable remuneration. \u00a0This does not apply to the Official Trustee whose remuneration is determined pursuant to section 163 theBankruptcy Act 1966(\u201cthe Bankruptcy Act\u201d) and Part 3 of theBankruptcy (Fees and Remuneration) Determination 2015, and is detailed inFees and charges.References to provisions relating to remuneration entitlements of trustees in this practice document have been updated to reflect amendments to the Bankruptcy Act introducedfrom 1 September 2017by the Insolvency Law Reform Act 2016 (\u201cthe ILRA\u201d). \u00a0However, despite the repeal of former sections 161B and 162 of the Bankruptcy Act by the ILRA, those sections (other than subsections 162(5A), (6) and (6A)) continue to apply in relation to remuneration for an estate of a bankrupt of a trustee appointed or who consented to actbefore 1 September 2017.[1]Division 60 of the Insolvency Practice Schedule (Bankruptcy) (\u201cthe Schedule\u201d; Schedule 2 of the Bankruptcy Act) and Division 60 of theInsolvency Practice Rules (Bankruptcy) 2016(\u201cthe Rules\u201d) set out the legislative framework for trustee remuneration. \u00a0This framework provides an entitlement for the trustee to be paid for necessary work properly performed in administering a regulated debtor\u2019s estate. \u00a0However, this does not automatically entitle the trustee to be remunerated for every hour of work undertaken in an administration.Division 60 of the Schedule and the Rules, as well as the review of third party costs provisions in section 65-20 of the Rules, indicate that trustees are entitled to take remuneration and disbursements that are:determined[2]by creditors or committee of inspection[3]reasonable and necessaryincurred legallysupported by documentation.A trustee has no entitlement for remuneration other than prescribed by the Schedule or Rules. \u00a0There is no entitlement to be remunerated for work other than in their capacity as the trustee of a regulated debtor\u2019s estate, nor for work undertaken illegally.\n\nThe purpose of this practice direction is to outline the position of the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy in regard to the principles on which a private registered trustee in bankruptcy is entitled to draw remuneration, the different methods available and what constitutes reasonable remuneration. \u00a0This does not apply to the Official Trustee whose remuneration is determined pursuant to section 163 theBankruptcy Act 1966(\u201cthe Bankruptcy Act\u201d) and Part 3 of theBankruptcy (Fees and Remuneration) Determination 2015, and is detailed inFees and charges.\n\nReferences to provisions relating to remuneration entitlements of trustees in this practice document have been updated to reflect amendments to the Bankruptcy Act introducedfrom 1 September 2017by the Insolvency Law Reform Act 2016 (\u201cthe ILRA\u201d). \u00a0However, despite the repeal of former sections 161B and 162 of the Bankruptcy Act by the ILRA, those sections (other than subsections 162(5A), (6) and (6A)) continue to apply in relation to remuneration for an estate of a bankrupt of a trustee appointed or who consented to actbefore 1 September 2017.[1]\n\nDivision 60 of the Insolvency Practice Schedule (Bankruptcy) (\u201cthe Schedule\u201d; Schedule 2 of the Bankruptcy Act) and Division 60 of theInsolvency Practice Rules (Bankruptcy) 2016(\u201cthe Rules\u201d) set out the legislative framework for trustee remuneration. \u00a0This framework provides an entitlement for the trustee to be paid for necessary work properly performed in administering a regulated debtor\u2019s estate. \u00a0However, this does not automatically entitle the trustee to be remunerated for every hour of work undertaken in an administration.\n\nDivision 60 of the Schedule and the Rules, as well as the review of third party costs provisions in section 65-20 of the Rules, indicate that trustees are entitled to take remuneration and disbursements that are:determined[2]by creditors or committee of inspection[3]reasonable and necessaryincurred legallysupported by documentation.\n\n",

and(b)\u00a0 before deciding whether it is appropriate to incur a cost, compare the amount of the cost likely to be incurred with the value and complexity of the administration.42-65 \u00a0Rate for tasks undertaken by trustee\u2019s staff(1)\u00a0 This section applies if the remuneration of a registered trustee is worked out wholly or partly on a time\u2011cost basis.(2)\u00a0 The registered trustee must ensure that time billed for a task undertaken in conducting an administration is charged at the appropriate rate for the level of staff who would be reasonably expected to undertake the task.42-70 \u00a0Keeping proper records in relation to work doneA registered trustee must ensure that proper records are kept that:(a)\u00a0 adequately describe the nature of the work; and(b)\u00a0 if the trustee\u2019s remuneration is worked out wholly or partly on a time\u2011cost basis\u2014provide evidence of the time spent on work done in conducting an administration.In the often-quotedAdsettcase,[18]the Full Bench of the Federal Court considered how the proper sum payable to a trustee was to be determined referring to the following principles:a trustee must exercise judgment so as to save the estate unnecessary expenditure of moneythe remuneration to which the trustee is entitled is to bejust and proper or reasonable remunerationin all the circumstances for the work carried out by the trustee.\u00a0 The right to payment is only lost for a specific reason as, for example, if no work was done or needed to be done or misconduct by the trusteea trustee is entitled as of right to full indemnity out of the trust estate against all his/her costs, charges, and expensesproperly incurred. \u00a0The words \u201cproperly incurred\u201d mean reasonably as well as honestly incurredtrustees ought not to be visited with personal loss on account of mere errors in judgment which fall short of negligence or unreasonableness.Against this background it is the Inspector-General\u2019s view that it is not reasonable to charge fees or costs relating to work undertaken by the trustee:when litigating based on self-interest (but see below comments in relation to theWenkartcase)when work undertaken is not in the capacity of trusteein continuing to administer an estate that should have been finalised, particularly when a surplus of assets over debts has existed and the trustee has not had due regard to the wishes of the bankruptrelating to an annual inspection by the Inspector-General\u2019s delegates; in responding to an Inspector-General investigation into a complaint lodged pursuant to section 12 of the Bankruptcy Act unless the complaint is spurious; or relating to an investigation in contemplation of disciplinary action, such as show cause action under section 40-40 of the Schedule.Each of these points is discussed in more detail below.\u00a0 There are other circumstances outlined in this document where the trustee has no entitlement to be remunerated as trustee.Litigation for self interestTheAdsetttest as to whether a trustee is entitled to remuneration in connection with litigation was \u201cwhether the expenditure was reasonably as well as honestly incurred\u201d. This reflects the principle that trustees must not act recklessly in instigating litigation and that the costs of unnecessary litigation will be payable by the trustee personally and not from the estate. \u00a0The Court in that case also stated that, in the case of a small and easily dissipated fund, all litigation should be avoided unless the chance of success is such as to render it desirable in the interests of the estate that the necessary risk should be incurred. \u00a0Finally, the Court stated that, where the resources applied to litigation are extravagant, the expenses would not be regarded as proper and must be borne by the trustee personally.This view was further supported in theSwaincase,[19]where Wilcox J had to determine whether the trustee became involved in litigation on behalf of the estate or on behalf of himself. \u00a0Wilcox found that the action was of self-interest, particularly since the trustee was seeking retrospective approval by the Court of his decision to sell a property having previously overlooked the need for creditor approval, and therefore the trustee was personally liable for costs and not entitled to be remunerated from the estate. \u00a0This self-interest view was further supported in the twoDoolan v Dare[20]decisions in which the Court found that the trustee had acted improperly in borrowing money to pay out creditors in the hope of preventing her removal, as trustee, by creditors.However, in theWenkartcase,[21]the Full Court found that a trustee was entitled to remuneration for defending successfully:in the face of sustained opposition from Dr Wenkart, the remuneration, costs, charges and expenses he had claimed at the time of the annulment \u2026 It is true, in a sense, that the litigation was undertaken by Mr Pantzer for his benefit, as the primary judge observed. \u00a0In the same sense, any litigation into which a trustee might be drawn concerning remuneration, disbursements and expenses is litigation for the trustee\u2019s benefit. \u00a0But to characterise it this way does not necessarily answer the question whether the trustee (or former trustee) has been properly involved in the litigation as an incident of having acted as a trustee charged with the responsibility of administering the bankrupt\u2019s estate.Other work not in the capacity of trusteeIn theRe Idecase,[22]a receiver went to a rural property\u00a0 The grazier appeared with a rifle, which he fired. The bullet ricocheted and struck the grazier\u2019s sister, who later died. \u00a0The receiver spent some time assisting the police with their inquiries, which he later sought to bill to the receivership. The Court denied his claim for remuneration for this time. \u00a0At [58], Ferris J\u2019s views in theMaxwellcase[23]received further airing:one does not indemnify the receiver for loss, one looks to the value of the work to the partnership. \u00a0In the present case the value of assisting the police with their enquiries to the partnership must be close to nil.At 59, Young CJ concluded that:>I think it is important to note that assisting police with any enquiry falls into a greater civic duty that surpasses all professional duties. \u00a0That the receivers\u2019 representative was a witness to the shooting and unfortunate killing of Ms Fallon places on them a civic responsibility to ensure that justice is done by assisting police in any way they can, for the greater benefit of the community.When further action by the trustee is not warrantedThe Inspector-General\u2019s expectation is that, where the bankrupt is solvent or has resources to pay out all the debts, the trustee should identify this early and give the bankrupt an opportunity to pay and take advantage of section 153A of the Bankruptcy Act before incurring any unnecessary expense, adopting a minimalist approach to the administration, safeguarding property and working with the bankrupt.In theTownsendcase,[24]the Court considered appropriate trustee remuneration in an annulment application. \u00a0The creditors had been paid and the bankrupt had attempted to pay the trustee\u2019s remuneration relatively early in the administration. \u00a0The trustee had refused to give an annulment believing that the investigation of a complaint made by the bankrupt to the regulator and the possibility of her litigating would increase his remuneration. \u00a0He could therefore not say that all the debts were paid.In the primary decision, Coker FM considered that the fees were excessive because the trustee had failed \u201cto bring this matter to a successful conclusion\u201d and ruled the trustee was only entitled to remuneration and costs up to the point when he knew all creditors had been paid and the bankrupt had sought to pay his fees. \u00a0However, on appeal, the Court noted that AFSA had taxed the remuneration and costs of the trustee and held that those taxed costs were therefore reasonable.ThePhillipscase[25]involved similar issues. \u00a0The bankrupt, shortly after being informed of his bankruptcy, sought to have his sequestration order set aside. \u00a0The trustee argued that orders annulling the bankruptcy were more appropriate, which would have entitled him to indemnity for his fees from the assets. \u00a0The trustee sought to be remunerated for over 50 hours of work, totalling more than $14,000, while the sole creditor\u2019s debt was $4888. \u00a0The debt and the petitioning creditor\u2019s costs had been paid shortly after the sequestration order was made.The Court raised concerns about the action taken by the trustee and expressed the view that the minimum fee the trustee could recover from the bankrupt pursuant to former section 161B of the Bankruptcy Act ($1388 at that time) was more representative of the work that should have been performed. \u00a0The Court also expressed the view that trustees should adopt a more cautionary approach in those cases where:the sequestration order is made with respect to a relatively small debtthe sequestration order is made in the absence of the bankruptthe debt is not incurred in the course of business or commercial dealingsthe bankrupt appears to have a significant asset, such as a home.\n\n",

SurveillancePursuant to section 12 of the Bankruptcy Act, the Inspector-General may inquire into or investigate the conduct of a bankruptcy trustee or administration. \u00a0The powers of the Inspector-General are delegated to officers in AFSA\u2019s Enforcement and Practitioner Surveillance division.The trustee is required to provide a report on matters under inquiry or investigation by the Inspector-General, if requested, and the Inspector-General may require the production of any books kept by a trustee and require a trustee to answer any inquiries.Inquiries and investigations by the Inspector-General can take a number of forms. \u00a0This may include:an annual inspection of the trustee\u2019s systems, practices and estatesan issue arising from the inspectionan enquiry following a complaint or tip-off receivedan investigation that may lead to disciplinary action, such as show cause action under section 40-40 of the Schedule.For some time, the Inspector-General has taken issue with registered trustees charging the estate for time spent in corresponding with AFSA. \u00a0It has been the Inspector-General\u2019s position that in the ordinary course the estate should not bear this cost. \u00a0This issue has been addressed in theARITACode of Professional Practice (\u201cthe ARITA Code\u201d) where it states:A practitioner should not claim remuneration for time spent:-\u00a0 communicating with regulators regarding complaints about the practitioner or the conduct of a particular administration, except where the complaint is spurious;-\u00a0 on regulator surveillance, professional audits or inspection of files, or on peer reviews; or-\u00a0 unsuccessfully defending a breach of the law or this Code.This practice imposes an obligation on AFSA to ensure that trustees are not put to unnecessary time and costs in responding to what might be considered spurious complaints. \u00a0It follows that AFSA, and not the trustee, should decide when this is the case. \u00a0If AFSA has completed an investigation of a complaint and a further complaint is made and it does not raise new issues, the onus is on AFSA to respond to the complainant without putting the trustee to further unnecessary expense. \u00a0In some circumstances, for example if a complainant is persistent and AFSA\u00a0 is required to approach a trustee again in relation to the same

            "Payment of trustee\u2019s remuneration by debtor or related third partyAn issue of concern in the administration of a regulated debtor\u2019s estate is the appropriateness or otherwise of a trustee arranging with the debtor to be remunerated or indemnified by the debtor or related third party in return for consenting to act as trustee on a debtor\u2019s petition bankruptcy.Some trustees have provided feedback suggesting that requesting surety or an up-front payment from the debtor or related third party is appropriate when assets or income contributions are not forthcoming. \u00a0It has also been suggested that a trustee should have some ability to be paid for the work undertaken when divisible property or contributions are doubtful and that this money assists a trustee in better performing their duties.It remains the Inspector-General\u2019s view that unless certain conditions are met (see paragraph 8.6 below), this practice is inappropriate and contrary to bankruptcy law and practice.\u00a0 A fundamental principle in bankruptcy administration is that a trustee is entitled to be indemnified for their reasonable remuneration and costs from trust money.It has been recognised by the Courts that a trustee cannot expect to recover all their costs and remuneration in every bankruptcy and that the scale of fees set by a trustee for themselves and their staff reflect this risk.\u00a0 In thePhillipscase[27], Riethmuller FM said:\u2026it must also be borne in mind that undertaking the role of trustee is a function that a trustee embarks upon aware of the inherent risk that he or she may not be remunerated. \u00a0If an estate contains no assets that can be realised then the trustee will remain without remuneration, unless creditors are prepared to fund investigations. \u00a0Prescribed remuneration rates are higher than the scale fees for similar work carried out in the course of litigation, presumably (at least in part) to recompense trustees for the risk inherent in the function.The result is that a lack of remuneration \u2018may be an incident of the risk associated with the performance of the trustee\u2019s duties in the period between the sequestration order and the expiry of the 21 days\u2019: see Garrett v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FMCA 19 at [34] per Lindsay FM. \u00a0It is certainly a well accepted incident of the risk inherent in the performance of the trustee\u2019s duties in assetless estates.In supporting these conclusions, the Inspector-General does not accept the argument of cost recovery as rationalising the practice of asking the debtor for money where there is a risk of no realisations.The only circumstances where such a payment might be accepted as valid is where the trustee:has informed the debtor of the income contribution regime and that any other payments or surety is purely voluntaryhas informed the debtor of alternative choices of trustee, should the debtor not be prepared to voluntarily make the paymentreports to creditors on the source and basis of the moneydoes not endeavour to execute legally enforceable contracts concerning the payment and does not pursue the debtor for any paymenttakes remuneration in accordance with section Division 60 of the Schedule to the Bankruptcy Act.This position has been endorsed in the ARITA Code.Treatment of money paid voluntarilyVoluntary payments that meet the conditions in paragraph 8.6 above made to the trustee by the debtor or by a third party related to the debtor must be banked into the estate account. \u00a0If the payments are taken as remuneration, Division 60 of the Schedule relating to approval of remuneration applies and the money attracts the realisations charge.It has been suggested that the words in subsection 6(1) of theBankruptcy (Estate Charges) Act 1997(\u201cthe Estate Charges Act\u201d) \u201creceived by a person\u201d should be read as \u201crealisations by the trustee\u201d relating to divisible property and contributions. \u00a0The Inspector-General does not support this proposition.The guiding principle in determining liability to pay the charge is whether the relevant amount was \u201creceived\u201d by a person mentioned in subsection 6(1) of the Estate Charges Act, and that the amount was received \u201cby the person in that capacity\u201d as required by subsection 8(2) of the Estate Charges Act during the charge period (less certain exclusions).Accordingly, in considering whether a trustee is liable to pay the charge in relation to a particular receipt, it is necessary to determine whether the amount was received by the person in their capacity as trustee of the estate of a bankrupt under the Bankruptcy Act.[28]The Bankruptcy Act and Rules includes a number of machinery provisions relating to the Estate Charges Act.[29]The Estate Charges Act and the Bankruptcy Act need to be read together as part of the same scheme for the regulation of bankrupt estates. \u00a0Expressions used in the Estate Charges Act ordinarily have the same meanings as in the Bankruptcy Act, subject to a contrary intention. \u00a0The Bankruptcy Act and Rules include a number of provisions concerning amounts received by a person in their capacity as trustee of the estate of a bankrupt.Hence provisions in the Bankruptcy Act and Rules concerning the receipt of money by a person in their capacity as the trustee of a bankrupt estate should be read as referring to the same amounts received by the person in their capacity as trustee of a bankrupt estate under the Estate Charges Act.It has also been suggested that payments by third parties taken as remuneration pursuant to the Bankruptcy Act can be paid directly to the trustee\u2019s private account or the firm\u2019s account operated by the trustee, thus avoiding the realisations charge. \u00a0Subsection 65-5(1) of the Schedule provides that a registered trustee \u201cmust pay all money received by the trustee on behalf of, or in relation to, the estate into administration account for the estate\u201d.[30]Failure to comply is a strict liability offence with a penalty of 50 penalty units.Further, trustees should be aware that payments made to them directly (including to their firm account) relating to remuneration could breach the prohibition on deriving profit or advantage from the administration of the estate contained in subsection 60-20(1) of the Schedule. \u00a0Failure to comply is a strict liability offence (unless an exception in subsection 65-20(3) of the Schedule applies) with a penalty of 50 penalty units.Hence the second principle in applying the Estate Charges Act is that the money that must be paid into an administration account and not mixed with other money under the Bankruptcy Act is the same money that for the purposes of the Estate Charges Act is received by the person in their capacity as trustee of the estate of a bankrupt under the Bankruptcy Act, and to which the charge imposed by paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Estate Charges Act applies (subject to any specific exclusion from the charge).As a corollary, money that does not have to be paid into an administration account, is not subject to the charge imposed by paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Estate Charges Act.With the exception of the Estate Charges Act subsection 8(2) exclusions, when a trustee receives a compliant voluntary payment from the bankrupt or third party and applies it in payment of remuneration and costs, they receive the money in the capacity as trustee of the estate. \u00a0The money must be deposited into the appropriate administration account on behalf of the estate and realisations charge is payable on the money.\n\n",
            "An issue of concern in the administration of a regulated debtor\u2019s estate is the appropriateness or otherwise of a trustee arranging with the debtor to be remunerated or indemnified by the debtor or related third party in return for consenting to act as trustee on a debtor\u2019s petition bankruptcy.\n\nSome trustees have provided feedback suggesting that requesting surety or an up-front payment from the debtor or related third party is appropriate when assets or income contributions are not forthcoming. \u00a0It has also been suggested that a trustee should have some ability to be paid for the work undertaken when divisible property or contributions are doubtful and that this money assists a trustee in better performing their duties.\n\nIt remains the Inspector-General\u2019s view that unless certain conditions are met (see paragraph 8.6 below), this practice is inappropriate and contrary to bankruptcy law and practice.\u00a0 A fundamental principle in bankruptcy administration is that a trustee is entitled to be indemnified for their reasonable remuneration and costs from trust money.\n\nIt has been recognised by the Courts that a trustee cannot expect to recover all their costs and remuneration in every bankruptcy and that the scale of fees set by a trustee for themselves and their staff reflect this risk.\u00a0 In thePhillipscase[27], Riethmuller FM said:\u2026it must also be borne in mind that undertaking the role of trustee is a function that a trustee embarks upon aware of the inherent risk that he or she may not be remunerated. \u00a0If an estate contains no assets that can be realised then the trustee will remain without remuneration, unless creditors are prepared to fund investigations. \u00a0Prescribed remuneration rates are higher than the scale fees for similar work carried out in the course of litigation, presumably (at least in part) to recompense trustees for the risk inherent in the function.The result is that a lack of remuneration \u2018may be an incident of the risk associated with the performance of the trustee\u2019s duties in the period between the sequestration order and the expiry of the 21 days\u2019: see Garrett v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FMCA 19 at [34] per Lindsay FM. \u00a0It is certainly a well accepted incident of the risk inherent in the performance of the trustee\u2019s duties in assetless estates.\n\nIn supporting these conclusions, the Inspector-General does not accept the argument of cost recovery as rationalising the practice of asking the debtor for money where there is a risk of no realisations.\n\nThe only circumstances where such a payment might be accepted as valid is where the trustee:has informed the debtor of the income contribution regime and that any other payments or surety is purely voluntaryhas informed the debtor of alternative choices of trustee, should the debtor not be prepared to voluntarily make the paymentreports to creditors on the source and basis of the moneydoes not endeavour to execute legally enforceable contracts concerning the payment and does not pursue the debtor for any paymenttakes remuneration in accordance with section Division 60 of the Schedule to the Bankruptcy Act.\n\nhas informed the debtor of the income contribution regime and that any other payments or surety is purely voluntary\n\nhas informed the debtor of alternative choices of trustee, should the debtor not be prepared to voluntarily make the payment\n\nreports to creditors on the source and basis of the money\n\ndoes not endeavour to execute legally enforceable contracts concerning the payment and does not pursue the debtor for any payment\n\ntakes remuneration in accordance with section Division 60 of the Schedule to the Bankruptcy Act.\n\nThis position has been endorsed in the ARITA Code.\n\nTreatment of money paid voluntarily\n\nVoluntary payments that meet the conditions in paragraph 8.6 above made to the trustee by the debtor or by a third party related to the debtor must be banked into the estate account. \u00a0If the payments are taken as remuneration, Division 60 of the Schedule relating to approval of remuneration applies and the money attracts the realisations charge.\n\n",
            "It has been suggested that the words in subsection 6(1) of theBankruptcy (Estate Charges) Act 1997(\u201cthe Estate Charges Act\u201d) \u201creceived by a person\u201d should be read as \u201crealisations by the trustee\u201d relating to divisible property and contributions. \u00a0The Inspector-General does not support this proposition.\n\nThe guiding principle in determining liability to pay the charge is whether the relevant amount was \u201creceived\u201d by a person mentioned in subsection 6(1) of the Estate Charges Act, and that the amount was received \u201cby the person in that capacity\u201d as required by subsection 8(2) of the Estate Charges Act during the charge period (less certain exclusions).\n\nAccordingly, in considering whether a trustee is liable to pay the charge in relation to a particular receipt, it is necessary to determine whether the amount was received by the person in their capacity as trustee of the estate of a bankrupt under the Bankruptcy Act.[28]\n\nThe Bankruptcy Act and Rules includes a number of machinery provisions relating to the Estate Charges Act.[29]The Estate Charges Act and the Bankruptcy Act need to be read together as part of the same scheme for the regulation of bankrupt estates. \u00a0Expressions used in the Estate Charges Act ordinarily have the same meanings as in the Bankruptcy Act, subject to a contrary intention. \u00a0The Bankruptcy Act and Rules include a number of provisions concerning amounts received by a person in their capacity as trustee of the estate of a bankrupt.\n\nHence provisions in the Bankruptcy Act and Rules concerning the receipt of money by a person in their capacity as the trustee of a bankrupt estate should be read as referring to the same amounts received by the person in their capacity as trustee of a bankrupt estate under the Estate Charges Act.\n\nIt has also been suggested that payments by third parties taken as remuneration pursuant to the Bankruptcy Act can be paid directly to the trustee\u2019s private account or the firm\u2019s account operated by the trustee, thus avoiding the realisations charge. \u00a0Subsection 65-5(1) of the Schedule provides that a registered trustee \u201cmust pay all money received by the trustee on behalf of, or in relation to, the estate into administration account for the estate\u201d.[30]Failure to comply is a strict liability offence with a penalty of 50 penalty units.\n\nFurther, trustees should be aware that payments made to them directly (including to their firm account) relating to remuneration could breach the prohibition on deriving profit or advantage from the administration of the estate contained in subsection 60-20(1) of the Schedule. \u00a0Failure to comply is a strict liability offence (unless an exception in subsection 65-20(3) of the Schedule applies) with a penalty of 50 penalty units.\n\nHence the second principle in applying the Estate Charges Act is that the money that must be paid into an administration account and not mixed with other money under the Bankruptcy Act is the same money that for the purposes of the Estate Charges Act is received by the person in their capacity as trustee of the estate of a bankrupt under the Bankruptcy Act, and to which the charge imposed by paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Estate Charges Act applies (subject to any specific exclusion from the charge).\n\nAs a corollary, money that does not have to be paid into an administration account, is not subject to the charge imposed by paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Estate Charges Act.\n\nWith the exception of the Estate Charges Act subsection 8(2) exclusions, when a trustee receives a compliant voluntary payment from the bankrupt or third party and applies it in payment of remuneration and costs, they receive the money in the capacity as trustee of the estate. \u00a0The money must be deposited into the appropriate administration account on behalf of the estate and realisations charge is payable on the money.\n\nAFSA\u2019s\u00a0roleAFSA has a number of key roles concerning remuneration.

person\u2019s bankruptcy?ConditionsThere are three conditions a creditor must satisfy before they can petition for a person\u2019s bankruptcy:the creditor must be owed an amount of $10,000 or more (or, where the petition is being presented by two or more creditors, the total amount owed to these creditors must be $10,000 or more)[2]the amount(s) owed is a liquidated sum (i.e. the amount payable is ascertainable and not dependent on the outcomes of other events) and is payable immediately or at a certain future timean \u201cact of bankruptcy\u201d (one of several events defined in section 40 of the Bankruptcy Act that could indicate that the debtor is unable to pay their debts) has been committed by the debtor within the six-month period before the presentation of the creditor\u2019s petition.\u00a0 (Most creditors\u2019 petitions are based on non-compliance with a bankruptcy notice.\u00a0 More information about bankruptcy notices is available inApplying for a bankruptcy notice.)The $10,000 minimum is provided for in section 10A of the Bankruptcy Regulations.Petition by a secured creditorA secured creditor can petition for a debtor\u2019s bankruptcy (or join one or more other creditors) in accordance with paragraph 2.1 above if:the amount owing exceeds the value of the security held by $10,000 or more, orthe amount owed is $10,000 or more, if the secured creditor states that they are willing to surrender the security for the benefit of creditors generally in the event that a sequestration order is made against the debtor.Petition against a partnershipIf a creditor is entitled to present a petition against any one of the members of a partnership, the creditor may present a petition against the partnership itself, or any one or more members of the partnership.Petition against joint debtorsA creditor who is owed money by two or more joint debtors (whether partners or not) may present a petition against all of the debtors.\u00a0 The Court can decide whether to make all the joint debtors, some of the debtors, one debtor or none of the debtors bankrupt.Substitution of a petitioning creditorShould a creditor who has initiated a petition not want to proceed with the petition, another creditor or group of creditors may seek the permission of the Court to continue with the petition.\u00a0 To seek an order for substitution, the

petition at least 5 days before the hearing (pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 4.05[3])that the debtor still owes the money.The Court also requires the petitioner to provide anextract of the NPIIshowing the debtor\u2019s insolvency history at the time of the hearing.\u00a0 The NPII search needs to be performed no earlier than the day before the hearing (pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 4.06).If the debtor disputes the creditor\u2019s claims, the debtor can oppose the creditor\u2019s petition.\u00a0 Common grounds of opposition are:the debt is not owing and/or a set-off existsan act of bankruptcy has not been committed, or the act of bankruptcy relied on by the creditor is deficientthe debtor is in fact solvent and able to pay the debt.The Court considers the evidence before it and makes a decision as to whether the debtor ought to be made bankrupt.\u00a0 If the Court is not satisfied, based on the evidence before it, that the creditor has met the requirements of the Bankruptcy Act and/or proved that the debt is owed, the Court may dismiss the petition.Where a petition has been dismissed by the Court, the creditor must give a copy of the order to the Official Receiver within 2 business days after the Court has entered the order (pursuant to section 13 of the Bankruptcy Regulations).If the Court is satisfied that the creditor has met the requirements of the Bankruptcy Act and proved that the debt is owed, the Court makes a sequestration order and the debtor becomes bankrupt.The creditor is required to file a copy of the sequestration order with the Official Receiver before the end of the period of 2 days beginning on the day the order was made (subsection 52(1A) of the Bankruptcy Act).If there is a delay in obtaining a sealed or endorsed copy from the Court, the creditor may file an unendorsed or unsealed copy with the Official Receiver to enable entry of the sequestration order on the NPII. \u00a0The creditor should subsequently provide the Official Receiver with a sealed or endorsed copy of the order once they have obtained one from the Court.As with the filing of a creditor\u2019s petition, the Official Receiver will accept notices of dismissal and

the Court\u2019s discretion.Where an adjournment of the hearing of the petition is granted by the Court, the creditor must give a copy of any order to the Official Receiver within two business days after the Court has filed the order (pursuant to section 13 of the Bankruptcy Regulations).\u00a0 The filing of the order enables the Official Receiver to update the NPII.Where the Court grants an

reasonable evidence to suggest that they will be able to pay the debt immediately.The stay is effective until it lapses or is lifted by the Court.A stay does not have the effect of preventing the change of a person\u2019s status to bankrupt.\u00a0 The bankrupt\u2019s property will vest in the trustee when the sequestration order is made, but the stay will generally prevent the trustee from

creditor in presenting a creditor\u2019s petition to the Court with a view to having a sequestration order made.Where a sequestration order is made and sufficient money realised in a bankrupt estate, the costs of the petitioning creditor will be treated as a priority payment in accordance with subsection 109(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act and item 7 of section 25 of the Bankruptcy Regulations, if either:the sequestration order provided for the priority, orif the sequestration order did not provide for the priority, where the petitioning creditor has returned to the Court and obtained an amended order providing for the priority.To avoid the need to return to the Court to obtain an amended order providing for the priority or to have the costs taxed, petitioning creditors are encouraged to obtain a sequestration order that fixes the total costs.\u00a0 This is provided for in the Courts\u2019 sequestration order templates (Form B7).Where the sequestration order requires the petitioning creditor to have its costs taxed, this process is undertaken by the Court and does not involve the Official Receiver.A creditor whose petition was afoot when a debtor\u2019s petition was presentedSection 25 of the Bankruptcy Regulations refers to a creditor who applied for a sequestration order, and is not limited to only the creditor whose petition resulted in the making of the sequestration order.\u00a0 This means that, where one petitioning creditor obtained a sequestration order, the taxed costs of a separate creditor who also had a petition on foot can also be paid out of the estate in accordance with the order of payments\u00a0 priorities specified in the legislation where sufficient money is realised.Petitioning creditor\u2019s costs in joint estatesIn the case of a sequestration order made against more than one debtor, unless the sequestration order provides to the contrary, the payment of the petitioning creditor\u2019s costs will depend on the nature of the liability of the debtors to the petitioning creditor (i.e. joint and several versus joint).Where the debt was joint and several, the petitioning creditor will be entitled to recover its costs out of any one or more of the joint and separate estates, where sufficient money is realised.\u00a0 The only exception to this would be if the sequestration order itself placed a restriction from which estate the costs could be paid.A petitioning creditor that is owed a debt jointly, as opposed to jointly and severally, will generally be able to recover its costs out of the joint estate where sufficient money is realised.\u00a0 Where there is a surplus\u00a0 in one or more of the separate estates (following payment of all fees, charges, costs, remuneration, debts and interest claims in those estate(s)), that surplus can be used to satisfy the costs.Where the costs specified in the order or the taxed costs do not reflect actual costsWhere the taxed costs of the petitioning creditor or the amount specified in the order are less than the total costs the petitioning creditor claims it incurred, the remainder of the costs do not constitute a provable debt in the estate.\u00a0 The amount was not a debt to which the bankrupt was subject and is an amount to be borne by the petitioning creditor (pursuant to section 51 of the Bankruptcy Act).Interest on the petitioning creditor\u2019s taxed bill of costsInterest on a petitioning creditor\u2019s taxed bill of costs can only be claimed in the estate in the case of a section 153A annulment, unless the Court order

depend on the type of property that forms part of the estate, the value of that property, the complexity of the bankrupt\u2019s affairs and other factors.\u00a0 Trustees charge for their services.A creditor who is petitioning the Court to make a debtor bankrupt is able to select a trustee and obtain the trustee\u2019s consent to administer the estate in the event that the Court makes a

The Official Receiver will provide information why it was considered inadequate, invite the bankrupt to file an updated statement of affairs, and identify what information the updated statement of affairs must address.

and(b)\u00a0 if full payment within the contribution assessment period or before discharge would cause hardship to the regulated debtor, consider giving the regulated debtor an extension of the time for payment of contributions liability.(4)\u00a0 The registered trustee must:(a)\u00a0 give the regulated debtor a copy of the assessment of income and contributions liability, setting out and explaining the basis on which the amount of any contributions liability has been calculated; and(b)\u00a0 notify the regulated debtor of the effect of section 139ZA of the Act (about internal review of assessment).(5)\u00a0 In this section:contribution assessment period has the same meaning as in section 139K of the Act.42-190\u00a0 Monitoring payment of contributions(1)\u00a0 Despite section 42\u2011170, this section does not apply to a registered trustee in relation to the estate of a deceased person in respect of which an order has been made under Part XI of the Act.(2)\u00a0 The registered trustee must:(a)\u00a0 monitor the payment of contributions by a regulated debtor to ensure the contributions liability is discharged; and(b)\u00a0 if necessary, take appropriate steps to recover contributions that remain unpaid after the time for payment has passed.The terms highlighted in the Standards set out above set the context for the following paragraphs of this practice document. \u00a0The duties and responsibilities of trustees as fiduciaries and officers of the Court are often couched in very subjective terms, making it a challenging aspect of personal insolvency law. \u00a0Notwithstanding this, practitioners can obtain guidance from the Standards and case law precedents led byEx parte James(detailedbelow) and the other cases listed inannexure A.\n\n",

the Standards set out above set the context for the following paragraphs of this practice document. \u00a0The duties and responsibilities of trustees as fiduciaries and officers of the Court are often couched in very subjective terms, making it a challenging aspect of personal insolvency law. \u00a0Notwithstanding this, practitioners can obtain guidance from the Standards and case law precedents led byEx parte James(detailedbelow) and the other cases listed inannexure A.\n\nTrustees as fiduciaries and officers of the courtA trustee in bankruptcy is classed as a fiduciary. \u00a0\u201cFiduciary\u201d is a term that may be defined in various ways but, essentially, it involves a person who has an obligation to act on behalf of another, subject to certain duties.A person who is a fiduciary generally owes two types of duties to those with whom they are in professional contact.\u00a0 These are:duty to use care and skilla duty to act in good faith.The duty to use care and skill is allied to common law obligations. \u00a0A person may be under a contract whose terms, express or implied, require that person to use skill and care. \u00a0Furthermore, such a person may owe a duty of care under the law of negligence. \u00a0The way in which the common law duties are vindicated are by an award of damages to the person damaged by the conduct. \u00a0With the breach of a statutory duty in the nature of a fiduciary duty, the remedy may be set out in the relevant statute or it may be an order that the defaulting fiduciary restore the fund or person to the state it or they would have been in but for the breach.The rule inEx parteJamesA trustee must act justly. \u00a0A trustee is considered an officer of the Court and, in exercising powers and discretions and making decisions, no lesser standard is to be expected of them than of a court or judge. \u00a0This principle is referred to as the rule inEx parteJames.[6]The rule requiring a trustee to act justly or fairly can apply even in situations where this may not otherwise be strictly required by law \u2013 for example, where some property has come into the hands of the bankrupt that was never intended to be property of the bankrupt but, in law, is their property.[7]In such circumstances, for the rule inEx parte Jamesto operate, it has been suggested that four requirements must be met. \u00a0These are:that the bankrupt estate has been enriched by the relevant transactionthat the claimant is unable to submit a proof of debt in the ordinary wayan honest person would consider it unfair for the trustee to retain the money in questionthe rule only operates so as to nullify an enrichment of the bankrupt estate.The rule inEx parte Jameswas referred to in two cases,Re Houston (Bankrupt)[8]andFoyster v Prentice.[9]InHouston, the trustees sought the Court\u2019s directions pursuant to the old subsection 134(4) of the Bankruptcy Act in order to call upon the executors of a deceased estate, of which the bankrupt was a beneficiary, to make anin speciedistribution. \u00a0It was held that it was not unfair nor unconscionable conduct of the trustees, in the sense ofEx parte James, to call upon and receive thein speciedistribution notwithstanding the consequences of leaving the bankrupt with a post-bankruptcy capital gains tax liability and the Australian Taxation Office with a fresh claim. \u00a0It can be concluded that the trustees acted prudently in seeking the Court\u2019s directions so that the full impact and negative consequences on all parties could be considered. \u00a0See alsoRe Hamilton.[10]InFoyster, the bankrupt made an unsuccessful application for review of the trustee\u2019s conduct and sought orders that the trustee had not acted impartially and had breached the fiduciary duty owed to him during the conduct of his duties and administration of the bankrupt estate. \u00a0At [185], Wilson FM stated:The complaint by the applicant can be answered when regard is had to the duties of a trustee in bankruptcy. \u00a0As I have said it is not the function of a trustee to act as directed by the bankrupt. \u00a0Nor is it his function to consult the bankrupt before taking any action, even action that may be adverse to the bankrupt\u2019s interests.And at [202]:There is authority that a trustee in bankruptcy is required to act as a fiduciary in relation to the estate of the bankrupt except where the Bankruptcy Act provides otherwise: Re Ladyman,[11]Pridmore v Magenta Nominees Pty Ltd.[12]However, in my view the trustee does not act as a fiduciary vis a vis the bankrupt in the widest sense of that word in equity. \u00a0As the cases extracted show, the trustee has public duties to efficiently administer the bankrupt estate.TheEx parte Jamesprinciple received further airing in:Thomas v Donnelly (John Robert Thomas v Max Christopher Donnelly[13]Nguyen v Pattison[14]Draper v Official Trustee.[15]In Nguyen, Weinberg J stated that in trustees making decisions:No lesser standard is to be expected of them than of a court or judge.InMuir v Bradley,[16]the court stated:A trustee is a person who must command and retain the confidence of the Court, of the creditors and debtors in bankruptcy proceedings and of the general community.\u00a0 His competence must be, and remain of a high order.If a trustee has a situation where they are considering whetherEx Parte Jamesapplies, unless the answer is obvious or all the creditors agree, the trustee would be wise to take legal advice or seek the direction of the court under section 90-15 of the Schedule.Independence and avoiding conflicts of interestA trustee is precluded from having a personal interest or a duty to a third party which conflicts with their fiduciary duty and duty as a trustee.[17]InRe Lamb[18]at [24], Sweeney J said:The objects of the Act are of public importance and it is of great importance to the community that the role given by the legislature to a trustee, is fulfilled only by persons who are, and who are seen to be, completely independent.In carrying out their duties, a trustee must not only act independently, but must be seen to act independently. \u00a0Therefore, if a conflict of interest arises the trustee must avoid or remove that conflict if it raises any perception of partiality. \u00a0The test is whether there might be, in the eyes of a reasonable person, a perception of conflict. \u00a0Where there is an actual or potential conflict of interest the trustee must notify the relevant parties and take appropriate steps to avoid the conflict of interest. \u00a0See:Southern Hotels[19]Pascoe v Deltawiz[20]Starkey v Rondo.[21]See also section 42-20 of the Rules and the ARITA Code of Professional Practice for Insolvency Practitioners, section 6, for further guidance.InRe Partridge,[22]cited in theSouthern Hotels, Starkey and Boral Montoro v McLachlan[23]cases, Lockhart J stated at [38] that a trustee:\u2026 must be scrupulously careful to ensure that he never allows himself to be placed in a position of conflict or potential conflict ... A registered trustee must not only be impartial; he must be seen to be impartial.InBoral Montoro Pty Ltd v McLachlan, the proposed trustee was a partner of a firm that was a creditor of the debtor. \u00a0The debtor was applying to persuade the Court not to appoint that trustee. \u00a0At paragraph 15, Wilson FM concluded:The solicitor for the petitioning creditor advised the court that the firm would not prove in the bankruptcy thereby seeking to dispel any suggestion of a conflict. \u00a0However the matter is not so simple, the appearance of such a conflict already exists and is not dispelled by such an intended course of action.Section 60-21 of the Schedule states that it will constitute an offence for a trustee (the first person) to:\u2026 give, or agree to offer to give, to another person, any valuable consideration; \u2026with the intention of securing their appointment or nomination as a trustee\u2026or securing or preventing the appointment or nomination of a third person as a trustee of a regulated debtor\u2019s estate.This highlights the severity of a perceived or actual conflict of interest where a financial inducement has been offered or given to another to obtain an appointment as trustee or prevent someone else\u2019s appointment.Impartial and fairAs per section 42-10 of the Rules, a trustee must act honestly and impartially in relation to each administration.A trustee plays a central role in the administration of estates under the Bankruptcy Act and is under a general duty to exercise the powers committed to them in such a fashion that the objects of the Bankruptcy Act, including those of equality between creditors and fairness to bankrupts and debtors, are served (seeReLamb).The minimum standard required of the trustee is that they shall handle the assets with a view to achieving the maximum return from the assets to satisfy the claims of the creditors and to provide the best surplus possible for the bankrupt (seeMannigel v Aitken[24]).The trustee\u2019s responsibility to the bankrupt of fairness and equality of interests between the bankrupt and their creditors and providing the best surplus possible are sometimes forgotten. \u00a0On occasion, trustees have only focused on providing the maximum return to creditors. \u00a0The fact that a trustee has to consider more than the interests of the creditors was reaffirmed inAdsett v Berlouis[25]where Northrop J concluded:the trustee has a dual function: first, to administer the estate in the interests of the creditors and the bankrupt; second, to exercise, as a public duty and for the public welfare, certain powers given, and duties imposed, under the Act, (Re Campbell; ex parte Official Trustee (1987) 13 FCR 326 at 329).[26]Justice Spender inDoolan v Dare[27]at paragraph 37 provided a summary of relevant case law and commentary on the duties of a trustee as follows:It is clear that the trustee has an obligation to administer the estate in the interests of the creditors and the bankrupt.The High Court approved the following statement of principle inAttorney- General (Cth) v Breckler[28]at [99]:Where a trustee exercises a discretion, it may be impugned on a number of different bases such as that it was exercised in bad faith, arbitrarily, capriciously, wantonly, irresponsibly, mischievously or irrelevantly to any sensible expectation of the settler or without giving a real or genuine consideration to the exercise of the discretion.This statement of principle was applied by Spender J inDoolan v Dareat [38]:In my judgment, the payment of the dividend was motivated not by a consideration of the interests of the creditors or of Mr Doolan but by a consideration of the trustee\u2019s own self-interest, and her conduct in borrowing the funds and declaring the dividend was for an improper purpose.InHughes Aircraft Systems International v Airservices Australia,[29]Finn J referred to the standard required of a trustee and said at [81]:... if a fiduciary is one expected to act in another\u2019s interest in a particular matter, that person is (informed consent apart) precluded from having a personal interest or a duty to a third party which conflicts with his or her duty to that other in that matter \u2013 irrespective of whether that interest or duty actually deflects the fiduciary from the loyal performance of that duty. \u00a0And so it can be said \u201c[a] man of integrity can be a defaulting fiduciary without ceasing to be honest\u201d: J. Glover, Commercial Equity: Fiduciary Relationship, Butterworths, Sydney, 1995, para 5.24.InHospital Products Limited v United States Surgical Corporation,[30]a judgment of the High Court, Mason J (as he then was) said at [103]:The rule that a fiduciary is not entitled to make a profit without the informed consent of the person to whom the fiduciary duty is owed is not limited to profits which arise from the use of the fiduciary position or of the opportunity or knowledge gained from it for it is said that the basis of this rule is the fiduciary may not place himself in a situation where his duty and his interest conflict: Consul Development Pty. Ltd. v. O.P.C. Estates Pty. Ltd. (1975) 132 C.L.R. 373, at p. 393.His Honour continued at 107:A fiduciary is liable to account for a profit or benefit if it was obtained(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 in circumstances where there was a conflict, or possible conflict of interest and duty, or(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 by reason of the fiduciary position or by reason of the fiduciary taking advantage of opportunity or knowledge which he derived in consequence of his occupation of the fiduciary position.\u2019\u201dA trustee will not be allowed to retain monies for distribution where it would be contrary to fair dealing to do so (seeRe Tyler[31]).Efficient and commercialIn accordance with paragraph 19(1)(j) of the Bankruptcy Act, a trustee has a specific duty to \u201cadminister the estate as efficiently as possible...\u201d. \u00a0Further, and pursuant to paragraph 19(1)(k) of the Bankruptcy Act, a trustee also has a specific duty to act \u201c\u2026 in a commercially sound way.\u201dAt paragraph 74 of the decision inGrowden v Committee under Part VIII of the Bankruptcy Act,[32]it is stated:The Tribunal, in undertaking this exercise, has concentrated on assessing whether the answers provided by the applicant were satisfactory for the purpose of his registration as trustee in bankruptcy. \u00a0His lengthy discursive answers are antithetical to efficiency and s19(1)(j) of the Act requires an estate to be administered as efficiently as possible by avoiding unnecessary expense. \u00a0If the applicant spends time carrying out the administration of an estate by researching and utilising novel interpretations he claims are available under the Act, rather than utilising more readily understandable and accessible provisions then efficiency will decline and expense will rise. \u00a0Additionally creditors, the bankrupt and the courts, when considering reports prepared by the applicant, are likely to experience some difficulty determining why he is relying on obscure combinations of provisions when more readily comprehensible and better known provisions are available. \u00a0Such usages are also not consistent with performing the functions of a trustee in a commercially sound way.\u201dThe trustee is not obliged to take steps which would be unrealistic or expensive (seeCiticorp Australia Ltd v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy[33]).InBoensch v Pascoe,[34]the Court said:A trustee does not (thereby) become disabled from an efficient and, if necessary robust, administration of an estate because his own fees may depend on the outcome.It has been recognised by the Courts that a trustee cannot expect to recover all their costs and remuneration in every bankruptcy and that the scale of fees set by a trustee for themselves and their staff reflect this risk. \u00a0InVaucluse Hospital Pty Ltd v Phillips,[35]Riethmuller FM said:\u2026it must also be borne in mind that undertaking the role of trustee is a function that a trustee embarks upon aware of the inherent risk that he or she may not be remunerated. \u00a0If an estate contains no assets that can be realised then the trustee will remain without remuneration, unless creditors are prepared to fund investigations. \u00a0Prescribed remuneration rates are higher than the scale fees for similar work carried out in the course of litigation, presumably (at least in part) to recompense trustees for the risk inherent in the function.The result is that a lack of remuneration \u201cmay be an incident of the risk associated with the performance of the trustee's duties in the period between the sequestration order and the expiry of the 21 days\u201d: seeGarrett v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation[36]at [34] per Lindsay FM. \u00a0It is consequently a well-accepted incident of the risk inherent in the performance of the trustee\u2019s duties in assetless estates.Sequestration orders being challengedThe trustee\u2019s duty to act in a commercially sound way should be given increased attention when there is an appeal against the making of a sequestration order.Trustees are faced with the challenge of securing the bankrupt\u2019s assets and administering the estate, while being cognisant of the fact that there have been cases where the court has not made provision for trustees fees to be paid where the sequestration order has been set aside (as opposed to the order being annulled by the Court, which is dealt with in section 154 of the Bankruptcy Act).InKyriackou v Shield Mercantile Pty Ltd (No 2)[37], in the Federal Court, a bankruptcy notice that had led to the making of a sequestration order was later declared invalid, and therefore set aside. \u00a0Because the sequestration order had been wrongly made in the first place, Weinberg J stated at [40]:It would be quite wrong, in my view, to burden Mr Kyriackou, who is the successful applicant in this proceeding, with the costs of administering the estate that should never have been made the subject of a sequestration order. \u00a0Regrettably, that leaves the Official Trustee with no obvious and immediate recourse against either the appellant or the first respondent. \u00a0It also leaves him with what might be considered a legitimate sense of grievance. \u00a0He may be out of pocket for doing no more than what he was required by statute to do.Weinberg J concluded at paragraph 42:It seems to me that a trustee who administers a bankrupt estate, in the knowledge that the bankrupt is challenging the validity of the sequestration order, must exercise caution when incurring expenses whilst the status of the bankruptcy remains uncertain.InPattison v Hadjimouratis,[38]which was decided by the Full Federal Court, a sequestration order was also set aside. \u00a0The key factors in this decision were, first, that the trustee was on notice at a very early stage that the bankrupt disputed his bankrupt status and intended to make an application to the court. \u00a0This early notice meant that the trustee was '\u201crequired to exercise caution in incurring expenses\u201d. \u00a0The second factor was that the debtor was solvent and wished to pay his debts. \u00a0As such, it was thought to be \u201cunfair\u201d to burden the debtor with the costs of administering the estate and the trustee in bankruptcy was left to pursue his remedies at general law. \u00a0However, Jacobson J noted that, where a sequestration order is \u201con foot\u201d, it is open to the court to annul it rather than setting it aside.\n\n",

Glover, Commercial Equity: Fiduciary Relationship, Butterworths, Sydney, 1995, para 5.24.\n\nInHospital Products Limited v United States Surgical Corporation,[30]a judgment of the High Court, Mason J (as he then was) said at [103]:The rule that a fiduciary is not entitled to make a profit without the informed consent of the person to whom the fiduciary duty is owed is not limited to profits which arise from the use of the fiduciary position or of the opportunity or knowledge gained from it for it is said that the basis of this rule is the fiduciary may not place himself in a situation where his duty and his interest conflict: Consul Development Pty.

            "InKyriackou v Shield Mercantile Pty Ltd (No 2)[37], in the Federal Court, a bankruptcy notice that had led to the making of a sequestration order was later declared invalid, and therefore set aside. \u00a0Because the sequestration order had been wrongly made in the first place, Weinberg J stated at [40]:It would be quite wrong, in my view, to burden Mr Kyriackou, who is the successful applicant in this proceeding, with the costs of administering the estate that should never have been made the subject of a sequestration order. \u00a0Regrettably, that leaves the Official Trustee with no obvious and immediate recourse against either the appellant or the first respondent. \u00a0It also leaves him with what might be considered a legitimate sense of grievance. \u00a0He may be out of pocket for doing no more than what he was required by statute to do.\n\nWeinberg J concluded at paragraph 42:It seems to me that a trustee who administers a bankrupt estate, in the knowledge that the bankrupt is challenging the validity of the sequestration order, must exercise caution when incurring expenses whilst the status of the bankruptcy remains uncertain.\n\nInPattison v Hadjimouratis,[38]which was decided by the Full Federal Court, a sequestration order was also set aside. \u00a0The key factors in this decision were, first, that the trustee was on notice at a very early stage that the bankrupt disputed his bankrupt status and intended to make an application to the court. \u00a0This early notice meant that the trustee was '\u201crequired to exercise caution in incurring expenses\u201d. \u00a0The second factor was that the debtor was solvent and wished to pay his debts. \u00a0As such, it was thought to be \u201cunfair\u201d to burden the debtor with the costs of administering the estate and the trustee in bankruptcy was left to pursue his remedies at general law. \u00a0However, Jacobson J noted that, where a sequestration order is \u201con foot\u201d, it is open to the court to annul it rather than setting it aside.\n\nPrinciples that can be concludedGeneral fiduciary principlesIn summarising these cases we can determine some basic principles on what is proper performance of duties and proper exercise of powers.A trustee must act justly. \u00a0Trustees are officers of the Court and in exercising powers and discretions and making decisions no lesser standard is to be expected of them than of a court or judge. \u00a0This is referred to as the rule inEx parte James. \u00a0Trustees have a general duty to exercise the powers committed to them in such a fashion that the objects of the Bankruptcy Act, including those of equality between creditors and fairness to bankrupts and debtors, are served.A trustee must act with a high duty of care, reasonable prudence and diligence, demonstrating competence of a high order, honesty, independence and impartiality to a standard that commands and retains the confidence of the Court, of the creditors and debtors in personal insolvency proceedings and of the general community.A trustee needs to have regard to the interests of the creditors, the bankrupt and the community.A trustee must not act in bad faith, arbitrarily, capriciously, wantonly, irresponsibly, mischievously or irrelevantly to any sensible expectation of the interests of the creditors or without giving a real or genuine consideration to the exercise of the discretion.A trustee is precluded from having a personal interest or a duty to a third party which conflicts with their duty \u2013 irrespective of whether that interest or duty actually deflects the trustee from the loyal performance of that duty. \u00a0The test is whether there might be, in the eyes of a reasonable person, a perception of conflict. \u00a0Where there is an actual or potential conflict of interest the trustee must notify the relevant parties and take appropriate steps to avoid the conflict of interest.Specific principlesWe can now overlay some of these general principles with the Standards in Division 42 of the Rules and the specific roles undertaken by a trustee in bankruptcy:When delegating matters to staffPursuant to section 42-4A of the Rules, the trustee must ensure that their employees comply with the Standards.Trustees need to consider when they should act personally, and when and how far they may delegate matters to staff. \u00a0Generally speaking, where an important or material decision has to be made or policy needs to be set, the trustee must do so personally. \u00a0That is not to say that they should not get advice from others or receive reports from members of staff, but the decision must be made personally.However, with administrative, routine or mechanical tasks, the trustee is expected to use common sense in having the task performed as economically as practicable.When dealing with informationA trustee must comply with section 15 of thePrivacy Act 1988when dealing with information relating to an administration.\u00a0 Section 15 of the Privacy Act provides that an APP entity (an agency or organisation) must not do an act, or engage in a practice, that breaches an Australian Privacy Principle.\u00a0 \u201cAPP entity\u201d is defined in section 6 of the Privacy Act and the Australian Privacy Principles are set out in Schedule 1 of the Privacy Act.The resolution to the Privacy Commissioner\u2019s investigation inOwn Motion Investigation v Bankruptcy Trustee Firm[39]was as follows:The Commissioner recommended that the trustee firm take steps to prevent general internet users from browsing the bankruptcy files, for example by securing the information using password protection. \u00a0The Commissioner also recommended that the trustee\u2019s opinion on whether bankrupts had breached the Bankruptcy Act be removed from the file made available to creditorsThe trustee firm agreed to these recommendations and, once satisfied that they had been implemented, the Commissioner closed the own motion investigation on the basis that the trustee firm had adequately dealt with the matter.When claiming propertyA trustee must act independently and impartially in undertaking transactions and dealings relating to the disposal of the property of a bankrupt, debtor or deceased person and when claiming assets must act reasonably and claim only the amountA trustee must realise only the divisible property/assets that:will give a cost-effective return to creditorscontribute to the payment of the costs of the administration, ormay be realised in accordance with a personal insolvency agreement[40]and, in doing so, needs to maximise the return both to creditors, maximise any possible surplus to the bankrupt and demonstrate fairness.ContributionsA trustee must:[41]act fairly and reasonably in determining the time for payment of any contributions liabilityif full payment within the contribution assessment period or before discharge would cause hardship to the bankrupt, consider giving the bankrupt an extension of the time for payment of contributions liabilitygive the regulated debtor a copy of the assessment of income and contributions liability, setting out and explaining the basis on which the amount of any contributions liability has been calculated andnotify the regulated debtor of the effect of section 139ZA of the Bankruptcy Act (about internal review of assessment).Remuneration, costs and dividendsIn conducting an administration, a trustee must:incur only those costs that are necessary and reasonablebefore deciding whether it is appropriate to incur a cost, compare the amount of the cost likely to be incurred with the value and complexity of the administrationconsider the views of creditors in relation to whether money held by the trustee should be applied to conduct further investigations in relation to the administration or distributed as a dividend.[42]As stated in part 8 ofRemuneration entitlements of a registered bankruptcy trustee:Similarly, in the administration of Part IV estates an issue of concern is the appropriateness or otherwise of a trustee arranging with the debtor to be remunerated or indemnified by the debtor or related third party in return for consenting to act as trustee on a debtor\u2019s petition bankruptcy.A fundamental principle in bankruptcy administration is that a trustee is entitled to be indemnified for their reasonable costs and expenses from trust money.[43]Remuneration entitlements of a registered bankruptcy trusteegoes on to say at paragraphs 8.6 and 8.7 that:The only circumstances where such a payment might be accepted as valid is where the trustee:has informed the debtor of the income contribution regime and that any other payments or surety is purely voluntaryhas informed the debtor of alternative choices of trustee, should the debtor not be prepared to voluntarily make the paymentreports to creditors on the source and basis of the fundsdoes not endeavour to execute legally enforceable contracts concerning the payment and does not pursue the debtor for any paymenttakes remuneration in accordance with Division 60 of the Schedule to the AcThis position has been endorsed in the ARITA Code of Professional Practice.Filing objectionsThe discretion to object to the bankrupt\u2019s discharge must be applied sensibly and not oppressively. \u00a0Misuse of this power would occur when it is used to punish the bankrupt.[44]InFrost v Sheahan,[45]it was decided that it was unacceptable for a trustee to extend a bankruptcy on the basis the bankrupt was a high income earner and an extension would realise more income contributions. \u00a0It was stated at [35]:In my opinion, the fact that there will be a further CAP is not a factor to be taken into account. \u00a0It is a consequence of an administration continuing, but not a reason to continue it.\n\n",

Guidelines 2020(\u201cthe Guidelines\u201d).\n\nThe purpose of this document is to outline the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy\u2019s expectations in relation to debt agreement administrators\u2019 duty to notify creditors that a 3-month arrears default has occurred, including best practice principles.\n\nLegislative framework\n\nTheBankruptcy Act 1966sets out the legislative framework regarding administrators\u2019 duty to notify creditors of a 3-month arrears default, in particular section 185LB and clauses 3.36 of theBankruptcy (Registration and Cancellation of Registration of a Debt Agreement Administrator) Guidelines 2020(\u201cthe Guidelines\u201d).\n\nPractical meaning and elements of the dutyWhat constitutes a 3-month arrears default?A 3-month arrears default occurs when:the debtor defaults on one payment (or more than one payment) due under the debt agreementthe debtor does not rectify the arrears when a subsequent payment is due. \u00a0This will trigger the 3-month \u201ctest time\u201da 3-month arrears default will then occur if, throughout the 3 month \u201ctest time\u201d, the debtor remained in arrears. \u00a0The threshold value of the arrears that will trigger a 3-month arrears notification will depend on when the debt agreement came into force. \u00a0This is discussed below.The 3 months arrears default occurs on the day immediately after the expiration of the 2-month period, i.e. 2 months and one day.How to measure 3 monthsThe 3-month time period is not to be measured or converted to days or weeks. \u00a0The 3-month period is only to be measured in calendar months.In cases where the last day for making all arrears payments in the 3 calendar months falls on a Saturday, Sunday or a public holiday, the 3 calendar month period is extended to the next business day.Notifying creditorsIt is the Inspector-General\u2019s expectation that administrators keep creditors informed of all material developments with respect to the debtor\u2019s affairs and any event that may impinge on the ability of the debt agreement to continue. \u00a0The debtor has the option when they fall into arrears to propose a variation and inform creditors of their circumstances and why they should be given more time to pay. \u00a0There may be valid reasons such as a period of unemployment between jobs or expenses associated with the birth of a child. \u00a0It is expected that administrators will take a lead role in business with debtors and creditors in times of default so all parties are aware of the various alternatives to address the situation.Consistent with the policy underlying the legislation, creditors should be kept informed of all material developments with respect to an administration. \u00a0In essence, administrators are facilitating the contract between the debtor and creditors and must not show bias to either party or their own interests.Debt agreements that commenced before 27 June 2019The following is applicable for debt agreements that come into forcebefore 27 June 2019.The administrator is required to notify creditors within 10 business days of the default occurring. \u00a0The notification to creditors is only required at most once every 3 months. \u00a0If there is more than one missed payment in one 3-month period (i.e. \u2018overlapping\u2019), the administrator is not required to notify creditors on the occasion of every missed payment within the 3-month period.It is the time period, not the number of missed payments, that is important. \u00a0This means that there does not have to be 3 months\u2019 worth of overdue payments. \u00a0A default may be as little as $1 if that is the amount of the arrears 3 months after the payment was due. \u00a0Administrators are to take the total value of the arrears and circumstances of the debtor into account when preparing the content of their default notice to creditors.The clock starts ticking for the 3-month period when the first default occurs. \u00a0However, if there is a missed payment that is also made good in the 3-month period and the total arrears is nil at the end of this 3-month period, the administrator is not required to notify creditors. \u00a0The question to be asked is whether the debtor was in arrears for the entire time in a 3-month period.In assessing whether the administrator\u2019s duty to notify creditors has been invoked, each 3-month test period must be reviewed in isolation. \u00a0In effect, each 3-month period stands on its own. \u00a0If there have been no missed payments in a particular 3-month period, the administrator is not required to report. \u00a0Where a payment has been missed that triggers the commencement of the 3-month test period and if that payment or other missed payments during the period have not been made up by the end of the period, it is expected that the administrator will not only report on the amount of arrears for that 3-month period but also the cumulative total of arrears to that point.Debt agreements commencing on or after 27 June 2019The following is applicable for debt agreements that come into forceon or after 27 June 2019.The administrator is only required to notify creditors of a default when the amount of arrears is significant, having regard to the value of the payments due and the cost of notifying creditors. \u00a0The 3-month arrears default occurs if the amount of arrears at the end of the 3-month period is over a specified threshold:the total amount that the debtor was in arrears exceeds $300 or 20% of the total of all of the due payments at the beginning of the 3-month period, whichever is higher, orif the total of all of the due payments was $300 or less, no payment was made in that period to reduce any of the due payments.Where the arrears over the 3-month period is over the threshold, but is rectified by the end of the 3-month period, the administrator is not required to notify creditors. \u00a0The question to be asked is whether the debtor was in arrears over the threshold for theentire timein a 3-month period.Notifications to creditors must be sent within 10 business days of the default occurring. \u00a0Notifications to creditors are only required at most once every 3 months. \u00a0Where the arrears exceeds the threshold more than once in a 3-month period, the administrator is not required to notify creditors on the occasion of every missed payment within the 3-month period.In assessing whether the administrator\u2019s duty to notify creditors has been invoked, each 3-month test period must be reviewed in isolation. \u00a0In effect, each 3-month period stands on its own. \u00a0If there have been no missed payments in a particular 3-month period, the administrator is not required to report.Reporting systems for 3-month arrears defaultsThe Bankruptcy Act requires the administrator to run 2 different 3-month arrears notification systems, depending on whether a debt agreement was/is in force before or after 27 June 2019. \u00a0To ensure no unnecessary regulatory burden is imposed, administrators may use one notification system for all debt agreements so long as it meets the 3-month arrears notice requirements of both pre- and post-27 June 2019 debt agreements.To meet both 3-month arrears notification requirements, the administrator will need to send an arrears notification, regardless of when the debt agreement commenced, when the debtor:has defaulted on one or more payments and did not rectify the arrears by the next due paymentthroughout 3-month period, was in arrears to any value, andremained so at the end of the 3-month period.The notification letter sent should then clearly state:the date the debt agreement commencedthe date of defaulting paymentthe amount of arrears at the end of the 3-month period following the defaulting payment20% of due payments for the 3-month periodtotal due payments for the 3-month periodthe arrears at the end of the 3-month periodthe cumulative total of arrears up to the date of the letterinformation about whether or not the notification letter is considered a formal notice under section 185LB of the Bankruptcy Act, for example:\u201cIf the debt agreement commenced prior to27 June 2019, this message is to be treated as a 3-month arrears default notice under section 185LB of the Bankruptcy Act 1966.If the debt agreement commenced on or after27 June 2019:in the event that the total arrears in the 3 months since the defaulting payment is greater than $300, or exceeds 20% of the due payments for the 3-month period; orin the event that the total due payments at the beginning of the 3-month period was $300 or less, and no payment was made in that period to reduce any of the due payments, then this message is to be taken as a 3-month arrears default notice under s185LB of the Bankruptcy Act 1966.\u201dFurther information that an administrator may also refer to in the notification letter includes the last payment made by the debtor and any arrangements in place, or to be put in place, for rectifying the arrears. \u00a0It is assumed that, when administrators only have post-27 June 2019 debt agreements, they will implement a system based only on the new thresholds.Major and minor defaultsWhile having regard to the level and severity of arrears, administrators are expected to provide creditors with concise information. \u00a0Administrators may choose to develop precedents which allocate the default as major or minor.Major\u2013 creditors are advised that the debtor is in arrears and administrators may recommend creditors take appropriate action, e.g. the debtor was made redundant then skipped without trace and the administrator has learned the debtor has changed bank accounts.Minor\u2013 creditors are advised that the debtor is largely compliant with payments, is only slightly in arrears and administrators may recommend to creditors that no action be taken, e.g. debtor has unexpected car repairs that has meant he has missed one week of payments. \u00a0All other payments have been made on time and\u00a0the one week of payments is slowly being made up with extra payments.\n\n",

She had agreed to pay $200 per week over 3 years.\u00a0 Her first payment was due 11 September 2017.\u00a0 Adelaide paid her $200 weekly payments for the first month of her debt agreement but then stopped paying towards the end of October 2017.The administrator referred to their records to discover that the last payment made by Adelaide was on 23 October 2017.\u00a0 Therefore, the last payment that was due but that remained unpaid was on 30 October 2017.\u00a0 The last day Adelaide has to pay all accrued arrears and to prevent the 3-month arrears default occurring is 30 January 2018.The 3-month arrears default occurred on 31 January 2018.\u00a0 The administrator carried out their duty to notify creditors of this occurrence within 10 business days of 31 January 2018 \u2013 this was done on 5 February 2018.\u00a0 The administrator advised creditors that the agreement was $2800 in arrears and that the debtor has skipped without a trace and, to their knowledge, it was unlikely that the debtor will bring payments up to date.\u00a0 Informed of the debtor\u2019s affairs and the considerable amount of arrears, the creditors resolved to terminate the debt agreement.The relevant dates in this example are:DateEvent4 September 2017Adelaide\u2019s debt agreement commences. \u00a0She is required to pay $200 per week over 3 years11 September 2017Date first payment due and paid by

30 days in a month = 90 days after 30 July 2016 nor from reference to weeks, e.g. 4.3 weeks in a month * 3 months = 13 weeksExample 2 \u2013 Minor defaultBrian\u2019s debt agreement commenced on 23 April 2016.\u00a0 He is required to pay $100 per week over 4 years.\u00a0 Brian\u2019s first payment was due 30 April 2016.\u00a0 Brian regularly pays his instalments but is paying $95 per week rather than the $100 required.It wasn\u2019t until 29 May 2016 that the administrator discovered that Brian was making the incorrect payment amount.\u00a0 After being notified, Brian immediately switched payments to $100 per week and has maintained these since.\u00a0 However, despite maintaining the $100 per week payment, Brian has not paid the accrued arrears of $25 from the first 5 weeks of the debt agreement.\u00a0 The last day Brian has to pay the accrued arrears of $25 is 30 July 2016.On 31 July 2016, the 3-month arrears default occurs.\u00a0 The administrator has a duty to report this 3-month arrears default to creditors and did so within 10 business days \u2013 this was done on 7 August 2016.\u00a0 The administrator advised creditors that the agreement was $25 in arrears and that the debtor had inadvertently paid the wrong amount for the first 5 weeks but has since paid the correct amount and has agreed to make good the arrears.\u00a0 Informed of the debtor\u2019s affairs and the small amount of arrears that were since brought up to date, creditors resolved to allow the debt agreement continue.In February 2017, Brian missed one weekly payment due to personal issues.\u00a0 He missed the payment that was due on 18 February 2017 but then made good these arrears on top of his normal payment on 4 March 2017.\u00a0 All other payments were maintained for the rest of the 3-month period, which began on 18 February 2017.\u00a0 On 19 May 2017 (i.e. 4 months and one day after 18 February 2017), the administrator is not required to report to creditors because the arrears have been rectified within the 3-month period.On 16 June 2018, Brian paid $50 rather than the required $100 and did not rectify this shortfall.\u00a0 The 3-month arrears default occurs on 17 September 2018 and the administrator needs to report to creditors within 10 business days of this date.\u00a0 The administrator contacted Brian and he immediately paid the $50 arrears amount into the administrator\u2019s trust account.\u00a0 In the notification to creditors sent on 19 September 2018, the administrator advised that, while the 3-month arrears default had occurred, the amount was only $50 and this amount had since been paid by Brian.\u00a0 It was the administrator\u2019s recommendation that the administration continue.The relevant dates in this example are:DateEvent23 April 2016Brian\u2019s debt agreement commences. \u00a0He is required to pay $100 per week over 4 years30 April 2016Date first payment due by Brian30 July 2016#Last day Brian has to pay the accrued arrears

to be calculated from reference to days e.g. 3 months x 30 days in a month = 90 days after 30 July 2016 nor from reference to weeks e.g. 4.3 weeks in a month x 3 months = 13 weeksExample 3 \u2013 Post-27 June 2019 debt agreementCharlotte\u2019s debt agreement commenced on 24 September 2019.\u00a0 She is required to pay $120 per week over 3 years.\u00a0 Although Charlotte begins the agreement paying $120 per week from 22 October 2019, she regularly pays $95 per week instead.\u00a0 Despite the administrator informing her that she was accruing arrears, Charlotte continues to pay $95 per week.\u00a0 Therefore, the last payment that was due but that remained unpaid would be 22 October 2019.\u00a0 The last day by which Charlotte has to pay all accrued arrears to prevent a 3-month arrears default occurring is 22 January 2020.\u00a0 Charlotte only enters a payment arrangement to rectify her arrears, by increasing her payments to $125 per week, on 28 January 2020.The 3-month arrears default occurs on 23 January 2020 only if the arrears is the higher of either $300 or 20% of the total of all due payments since the beginning of the 3-month period.For the 3 months preceding the default, the total due payments during this period were $1680.\u00a0 20% of this amount is $336, which would be the applicable threshold as it is over $300.The total arrears during the 3-month period were $350.\u00a0 This exceeds the threshold and results in a 3-month arrears default occurring on 23 January 2020.The administrator has a duty to report this 3-month arrears default to creditors and does so within 10 business days \u2013 this is done on 30 January 2020.\u00a0 The administrator advised creditors of the arrears and that a payment arrangement was in place and creditors resolve to allow the debt agreement to continue.Note the relevant dates in this example are:DateEvent24 September 2019Charlotte\u2019s debt agreement commences. \u00a0She is required to pay $120 per

the same example above, if Charlotte decided to regularly pay $100 per week from 22 October 2019 instead of $95, the total arrears during the 3-month period would have been $280.\u00a0 Since this amount does not exceed the threshold (i.e. $336), the administrator would not have a duty to report a 3-month arrears default\n\n",
            "Example 1 \u2013 Major defaultAdelaide\u2019s debt agreement commenced on 4 September 2017.\u00a0 She had agreed to pay $200 per week over 3 years.\u00a0 Her first payment was due 11 September 2017.\u00a0 Adelaide paid her $200 weekly payments for the first month of her debt agreement but then stopped paying towards the end of October 2017.The administrator referred to their records to discover that the last payment made by Adelaide was on 23 October 2017.\u00a0 Therefore, the last payment that was due but that remained unpaid was on 30 October 2017.\u00a0 The last day Adelaide has to pay all accrued arrears and to prevent the 3-month arrears default occurring is 30 January 2018.The 3-month arrears default occurred on 31 January 2018.\u00a0 The administrator carried out their duty to notify creditors of this occurrence within 10 business days of 31 January 2018 \u2013 this was done on 5 February 2018.\u00a0 The administrator advised creditors that the agreement was $2800 in arrears and that the debtor has skipped without a trace and, to their knowledge, it was unlikely that the debtor will bring payments up to date.\u00a0 Informed of the debtor\u2019s affairs and the considerable amount of arrears, the creditors resolved to terminate the debt agreement.The relevant dates in this example are:DateEvent4 September 2017Adelaide\u2019s debt agreement

e.g. 4.3 weeks in a month * 3 months = 13 weeksExample 2 \u2013 Minor defaultBrian\u2019s debt agreement commenced on 23 April 2016.\u00a0 He is required to pay $100 per week over 4 years.\u00a0 Brian\u2019s first payment was due 30 April 2016.\u00a0 Brian regularly pays his instalments but is paying $95 per week rather than the $100 required.It wasn\u2019t until 29 May 2016 that the administrator discovered that Brian was making the incorrect payment amount.\u00a0 After being notified, Brian immediately switched payments to $100 per week and has maintained these since.\u00a0 However, despite maintaining the $100 per week payment, Brian has not paid the accrued arrears of $25 from the first 5 weeks of the debt agreement.\u00a0 The last day Brian has to pay the accrued arrears of $25 is 30 July 2016.On 31 July 2016, the 3-month arrears default occurs.\u00a0 The administrator has a duty to report this 3-month arrears default to creditors and did so within 10 business days \u2013 this was done on 7 August 2016.\u00a0 The administrator advised creditors that the agreement was $25 in arrears and that the debtor had inadvertently paid the wrong amount for the first 5 weeks but has since paid the correct amount and has agreed to make good the arrears.\u00a0 Informed of the debtor\u2019s affairs and the small amount of arrears that were since brought up to date, creditors resolved to allow the debt agreement continue.In February 2017, Brian missed one weekly payment due to personal issues.\u00a0 He missed the payment that was due on 18 February 2017 but then made good these arrears on top of his normal payment on 4 March 2017.\u00a0 All other payments were maintained for the rest of the 3-month period, which began on 18 February 2017.\u00a0 On 19 May 2017 (i.e. 4 months and one day after 18 February 2017), the administrator is not required to report to creditors because the arrears have been rectified within the 3-month period.On 16 June 2018, Brian paid $50 rather than the required $100 and did not rectify this shortfall.\u00a0 The 3-month arrears default occurs on 17 September 2018 and the administrator needs to report to creditors within 10 business days of this date.\u00a0 The administrator contacted Brian and he immediately paid the $50 arrears amount into the administrator\u2019s trust account.\u00a0 In the notification to creditors sent on 19 September 2018, the administrator advised that, while the 3-month arrears default had occurred, the amount was only $50 and this amount had since been paid by Brian.\u00a0 It was the administrator\u2019s recommendation that the administration continue.The relevant dates in this example are:DateEvent23 April 2016Brian\u2019s debt agreement commences. \u00a0He is required to pay $100 per week over 4 years30 April 2016Date first payment due by Brian30 July 2016#Last day Brian has to pay the accrued arrears of $2531 July 20163-month arrears default occurs7 August 2016The

commenced on 24 September 2019.\u00a0 She is required to pay $120 per week over 3 years.\u00a0 Although Charlotte begins the agreement paying $120 per week from 22 October 2019, she regularly pays $95 per week instead.\u00a0 Despite the administrator informing her that she was accruing arrears, Charlotte continues to pay $95 per week.\u00a0 Therefore, the last payment that was due but that remained unpaid would be 22 October 2019.\u00a0 The last day by which Charlotte has to pay all accrued arrears to prevent a 3-month arrears default occurring is 22 January 2020.\u00a0 Charlotte only enters a payment arrangement to rectify her arrears, by increasing her payments to $125 per week, on 28 January 2020.The 3-month arrears default occurs on 23 January 2020 only if the arrears is the higher of either $300 or 20% of the total of all due payments since the beginning of the 3-month period.For the 3 months preceding the default, the total due payments during this period were $1680.\u00a0 20% of this amount is $336, which would be the applicable threshold as it is over $300.The total arrears during the 3-month period were $350.\u00a0 This exceeds the threshold and results in a 3-month arrears default occurring on 23 January 2020.The administrator has a duty to report this 3-month arrears default to creditors and does so within 10 business days \u2013 this is done on 30 January 2020.\u00a0 The administrator advised creditors of the arrears and that a payment arrangement was in place and creditors resolve to allow the debt agreement to continue.Note the relevant dates in this example are:DateEvent24 September 2019Charlotte\u2019s debt agreement commences. \u00a0She is required to pay $120 per week over 3 years1 October 2019Date first payment due and paid by Ms C22 October

required to certify:the administrator must consent to deal with the identified property in the way specified in the proposalthe administrator has given the debtor the information about alternative means of dealing with financial difficulty as prescribed by the Bankruptcy Regulationsthe administrator has reasonable grounds to believe that the debtor is likely to be able to discharge the obligations created by the agreement as and when they fall due having regard to the circumstances in existence at the time when the debtor\u2019s statement of affairs was signed by the debtorthe administrator has reasonable grounds to believe that all information required to be set out in the debtor\u2019s statement of affairs and proposal explanatory statement, has been set out and they have a reasonable basis for believing that the debtor has properly disclosed their affairs to creditors.For proposals lodged with the Official Receiver on or after 27 June 2019, the following also apply:where a broker has referred a debtor to the administrator, the administrator must specify the nature of their relationship with the broker, and set out any payments made or to be made to the brokerwhere a related entity of the administrator is an affected creditor, the administrator must specify the name and nature of their relationship with the affected creditor.An administrator is required to ensure the certification provided to the Official Receiver with the proposal is correct. \u00a0If an administrator does not certify these matters in a proposal, the proposal will not be accepted. \u00a0The administrator must complete the certificate using the online form.For single creditor proposals, practitioners should be aware that the Official Receiver has a published policy in

            "Inspector-General expectationsConsentIt is essential that an administrator consents to act. \u00a0Should the creditors accept the debtor\u2019s proposal, the completed consent allows an administrator to act as soon as the debt agreement commences.The administrator must sign the certification to consent. \u00a0An electronic signature is acceptable, however the signature must be that of the administrator. \u00a0The administrator cannot delegate the signing of the certificate to another person.Prescribed informationThe administrator must give the debtor the prescribed information and ensure the debtor reads, understands and signs the form. \u00a0It is expected that administrators will explain the meaning of the prescribed information to debtors and answer any questions debtors have. \u00a0A sample of debtors is checked through the course of the Inspector-General\u2019s inspection program.The original of the signed prescribed information form must be retained on the administrator\u2019s file, either in paper or electronic form.It is particularly important that administrators explain the effect of personal insolvency administrations on credit agency reporting and the record on theNational Personal Insolvency Index(\u201cNPII\u201d). \u00a0Administrators should also explain that lodging a proposal is an act of bankruptcy, even if the proposal is not accepted by creditors, and that creditors could use this to apply to the court to make the debtor bankrupt.In assisting the debtor to make informed choices about alternative means of dealing with financial difficulty, the administrator will need to be capable of providing debtors with information about the options available to them. \u00a0This includes, but is not limited to, the Bankruptcy Act, general bankruptcy concepts relevant to a debtor formulating a proposal, the explanatory statement and completing a statement of affairs that discloses income, property and liabilities. \u00a0It is expected that an administrator will be able to explain to a debtor what the differences are between the various options and the consequences.To be capable of doing this, the type of general insolvency and business knowledge expected of the administrator includes the following matters:A basic knowledge of the Bankruptcy Act. \u00a0In particular, an administrator needs to know the options and their impact on a debtor. \u00a0This includes the bankruptcy, personal insolvency agreement and debt agreement options available under the Bankruptcy Act, how people become bankrupt, what property a bankrupt could retain, bankrupts\u2019 and creditors\u2019 rights, income contributions and a general awareness of antecedent transactions.A detailed knowledge of debt agreement legislation detailing the duties of administrators, including legislative requirements for administrators to cooperate with the Inspector-General\u2019s inquiries and investigations.A general knowledge of other financial and banking options available including refinancing, mortgages, informal arrangements and banking industry hardship provisions.Knowledge of common business structures such as companies, partnerships, trusts and sole traders, the liability and tax implications arising from these structures, commercial and financial transactions and documents, including leases, hire purchase, guarantees, caveats, mortgages and other security, and basic contract law.Affordability and sustainabilityTo properly certify that an administrator has reasonable grounds for believing that the debtor is likely to be able to discharge the obligations created by the agreement as they fall due, they are expected to demonstrate the following abilities based on their knowledge and business systems:to evaluate financial choices and understand money and debt, including how to budget and planto recognise and competently inform debtors on life events that affect every day financial decisions, including events in the general economyto determine what budgeting processes are needed to assist the debtorhow they plan to assist the debtor determine what they can afford to pay. \u00a0For example, does the administrator plan to use supporting systems such as the Australian Bureau of Statistics Expenditure Survey or Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia research to assist or determine whether the debtor\u2019s disclosed expenses are reasonable?Administrators must look behind the budget supplied by the debtor and apply independent tests such as allowance for lifestyle expenses, copies of payslips to verify all sources of income including overtime, allowances and the nature of employment. \u00a0Where a debtor is employed on a casual basis, it is expected that an administrator would require further evidence (such as copies of payslips over a longer period of time) to establish the debtor\u2019s level of income compared to a debtor working full time. \u00a0It is not acceptable to certify that the debtor can afford what is being proposed without a detailed review of the debtor\u2019s budget.Full disclosureTo properly certify that an administrator has reasonable grounds to believe that the debtor has made full and true disclosure of their claims in the proposal and accompanying explanatory statement and statement of affairs, they must have an understanding of what enquiries can be easily made both from the debtor and other resources.For example, an administrator is expected to know what evidence they will require from a debtor concerning income, expenses, liabilities and assets; what simple checks can be undertaken and what evidence they will retain depending on the debtor\u2019s circumstances.There is no prescribed requirement about the enquiries an administrator should make to establish reasonable grounds that the debtor has made full and true disclosure of their affairs. \u00a0Full disclosure of all creditors is important to ensure that creditors are:notified of the proposalfully aware of a debtor\u2019s current circumstances and make informed decisionssuspending collection action against the debtgiven the opportunity to provide details of their debt and vote.In most cases, it is appropriate for the administrator to examine bank and credit card statements, review employment history and payslips and ask if tax returns have been filed. \u00a0Credit reports or direct contact with creditors to clarify amounts may also be needed.Disclosure of brokersA broker is any person or corporation who acts as an intermediary or agent and facilitates a debt agreement proposal with the administrator as an administrator of the agreement. \u00a0An administrator must disclose in the proposal any broker who refers a debtor to them. \u00a0The details that must be disclosed include the name of the broker, the nature of the relationship with the broker and any payments made or to be made to the broker for the referral.It is imperative that administrators are open and frank in their disclosure of brokers to ensure that all referral arrangements are accounted for and that affected creditors are fully informed when voting on whether to accept the proposal.Disclosure of related entitiesTo ensure that the voting process is transparent, the administrator must disclose any related entity that is an affected creditor in the proposal. \u00a0It must state the name and relationship between the affected creditor and the administrator. \u00a0For proposals lodged with the Official Receiver on or after 27 June 2019, creditors who are related entities of the administrator will not be invited to vote on proposals, and any votes made by a related entity to the administrator will be disregarded by the Official Receiver.\n\n",

to take reasonable grounds to certify. \u00a0It is not possible to be too prescriptive in outlining what constitutes reasonable grounds as each debtor\u2019s circumstances vary and will require different levels of verification. \u00a0This is to be monitored and assessed on a case-by-case basis.For example, if a debtor has a house and vehicle, it is not always expected nor mandatory that the administrator has completed property and vehicle searches and received appraisals before formulating the proposal. \u00a0What would be reasonable depends on the circumstances. \u00a0The same approach is applicable for certifying variation proposals. \u00a0Where there has been a material change in the value of an asset, the administrator would be expected to conduct searches before formulating the variation proposal. \u00a0Administrators may also consider adding a file note to explain their decision not to complete searches where they believe it is not required. \u00a0Regarding the major asset items it would be reasonable for the administrator to check the extent of the secured debt with the debtor and whether it is separate or joint, and ask the debtor to explain the basis on which a particular value was estimated. \u00a0Depending on the responses further enquiry may be required. \u00a0This is particularly relevant if the debtor resides and has property in a different state to that of the administrator. \u00a0If the debtor did not comply, the administrator may form the opinion that the certification required under subsection 185C(2D) of the Bankruptcy Act should not be given and the proposal could not be lodged with the Official Receiver for processing.A breach of the certification duty will arise if:the Inspector-General looks at records retained and has concerns about the quality, extent of questioning and verification by the administrator before certification (e.g. the prescribed information being provided, the accuracy of information or the sustainability of the proposal; monitoring of staff brokers or agents)administrators are unable to present evidence to show they verified issues that are clearly inconsistent or that appear to AFSA as dubious before they certified.Administrators and AFSA need to assess each on a case-by-case basis based on what is reasonable in the debtor\u2019s circumstances.Reasonable grounds \u2013 assigned debtsDetermining which creditors vote on a proposal is ultimately a responsibility of the Official Receiver and delegates of the Official Receiver make such decisions when processing a proposal. \u00a0However, in doing this, reliance is placed on the information disclosed by the debtor and certified as complete by the administrator. \u00a0The Inspector-General has certain expectations of administrators in relation to assigned debts, to ensure that proposals and variations to debt agreements are properly managed.Administrators need to be aware of the legislative limits within which they conduct their enquiries and ensure this aligns with and complements the statutory role and responsibility of the Official Receiver. \u00a0Division 2 of Part IX of the Bankruptcy Act establishes that only the Official Receiver is empowered to undertake certain assessments and determine who may vote on a proposal. \u00a0As such, an administrator\u2019s certification duty does not extend to making those assessments or decisions. \u00a0The certification duty of the administrator pursuant to subsection 185C(2D) does not provide license for a forensic investigation scrutinising the validity of an assigned debt. \u00a0It should not be confused with formalities required for the transfer of legal title under the various Conveyancing Acts operating in the States and Territories.The administrator must have reasonable grounds to believe that the assignee has been assigned the debts. \u00a0In this regard the following principles apply:The administrator is entitled to receive evidence that an assignment has been effected. \u00a0However, an agreement for assignment does not need to take any particular form. \u00a0The administrator could be satisfied where it is provided evidence of an agreement that enables it to identify the personal information of the debtor and reasonable details of the assigned debt (such as the amount outstanding, relevant account numbers where available and consideration paid by the assignee for the debt).The administrator must have regard to the substantive effect of the documentation that is provided and must not have undue regard to the form in which it is provided. \u00a0As equitable assignees are capable of being a party to a debt agreement, it follows that assignments do not have to meet the legal title requirements before an administrator can be satisfied that the assignment is effective.A single agreement may relate to more than one assignment of debt.In determining the owner of a debt, consider what the debtor understands of their financial affairs. \u00a0However, when conducting their enquiries, administrators may become aware of assignments before the debtor received formal notice, so administrators may have more up-to-date information. \u00a0Generally speaking, the debtor will be the best source of information about the existence of debts, and creditors will be source of information about the owner of debts. \u00a0When in doubt, it is open for the administrator to contact the assignee and for the assignor to clarify who they believe is the owner of the debt. \u00a0This should resolve most questions about ownership. \u00a0If, after this action, there remains doubt, the administrator should advise the Official Receiver when submitting the proposal. \u00a0If creditors are aggrieved by the decision of the administrator, they may complain to the Inspector-General.The duties of an administrator described above can be distinguished from those duties relating to assignments occurring after a proposal has been accepted. \u00a0Where a debt is assigned during the administration of the agreement, the Official Receiver\u2019s involvement is limited. \u00a0Therefore, it falls solely to the administrator to establish the owner of the debt and to whom dividends should be paid. \u00a0Even so, administrators are encouraged not to take an approach of form over substance to the assessment, particularly where the assignee and the assignor are not disputing the assignment. \u00a0The principles in paragraph 6.6 are still relevant once a proposal has been accepted, and would reflect a reasonable approach by an administrator.Stage of agreementAssignment informationHow to treat the assignmentOutcomePre-debt agreement proposalDebtor is aware a debt has been assigned.\u00a0 Notice provided to

party to the debt agreement, entitled to dividendsCertification requirements in the event of natural disasters and/or pandemicsIt is noted that in the event of natural disasters and pandemics, the impacts on individuals may include the disruption of, or loss of work or income, loss or damage to accommodation and restricted ability to communicate. In order that affected debtors are not unduly disadvantaged, administrators should be proactive in discussing with them the potential to vary the debt agreement.It is noted that there may be consequent difficulties for administrators complying with their certification duties if there is a requirement for debt agreements to be varied. In these circumstances, the Inspector-General will apply a practical approach to certification. As it is likely to be more difficult for administrators to obtain written evidence in the event of natural disasters or pandemics, it may be appropriate in these circumstances for administrators to rely on file notes to document the debtor\u2019s circumstances and/or administrators\u2019 decisions.Administrators are also encouraged to take into consideration the impact of the natural disasters or pandemics on the affected debtor\u2019s ability to meet their obligations under the agreement, and accordingly act with extra sensitivity and empathy in this regard. For example, if the debtor is in arrears with respect to their debt agreement as a result of the impact of floods and a variation of the debt agreement is required, make sure requests for variation are dealt with promptly and that creditors are made aware of the debtor\u2019s circumstances. If the debtor loses their job or their circumstances materially change due to the disruption caused by a natural disaster or pandemic, this will constitute the requisite substantial, unforeseen changes needed to extend a debt agreement from 3 to up to 5 years.\n\n",

after a proposal has been accepted. \u00a0Where a debt is assigned during the administration of the agreement, the Official Receiver\u2019s involvement is limited. \u00a0Therefore, it falls solely to the administrator to establish the owner of the debt and to whom dividends should be paid. \u00a0Even so, administrators are encouraged not to take an approach of form over substance to the assessment, particularly where the assignee and the assignor are not disputing the assignment. \u00a0The principles in paragraph 6.6 are still relevant once a proposal has been accepted, and would reflect a reasonable approach by an administrator.\n\nStage of agreementAssignment informationHow to treat the assignmentOutcomePre-debt agreement proposalDebtor is aware a debt has been

            "Certification requirements in the event of natural disasters and/or pandemics\n\nIt is noted that in the event of natural disasters and pandemics, the impacts on individuals may include the disruption of, or loss of work or income, loss or damage to accommodation and restricted ability to communicate. In order that affected debtors are not unduly disadvantaged, administrators should be proactive in discussing with them the potential to vary the debt agreement.\n\nIt is noted that there may be consequent difficulties for administrators complying with their certification duties if there is a requirement for debt agreements to be varied. In these circumstances, the Inspector-General will apply a practical approach to certification. As it is likely to be more difficult for administrators to obtain written evidence in the event of natural disasters or pandemics, it may be appropriate in these circumstances for administrators to rely on file notes to document the debtor\u2019s circumstances and/or administrators\u2019 decisions.\n\nAdministrators are also encouraged to take into consideration the impact of the natural disasters or pandemics on the affected debtor\u2019s ability to meet their obligations under the agreement, and accordingly act with extra sensitivity and empathy in this regard. For example, if the debtor is in arrears with respect to their debt agreement as a result of the impact of floods and a variation of the debt agreement is required, make sure requests for variation are dealt with promptly and that creditors are made aware of the debtor\u2019s circumstances. If the debtor loses their job or their circumstances materially change due to the disruption caused by a natural disaster or pandemic, this will constitute the requisite substantial, unforeseen changes needed to extend a debt agreement from 3 to up to 5 years.\n\nRetention of documentationDocumentation collated in support of a proposal and in the course of certifying is not to be forwarded to the Official Receiver when filing the proposal. \u00a0On occasion, the Official Receiver may request documentation for review.Administrators are not committing a breach of their certification duty if they decide to keep only minor documentation provided that, on review by the Inspector-General, the information retained is sufficient to conclude the certification was reasonably made. \u00a0This is with the exception of records that must be retained to comply with industry-wide conditions of registration relating to disclosure of information to debtors. \u00a0Administrators are required to exercise sound judgment on a case-by-case basis, which is best illustrated by 2 examples.Example 1 \u2013 Acceptable retention of documentationSally works for the local council as a clerk and earns $45,000 per annum. \u00a0She owns a second hand 1985 Mazda vehicle worth $5000 and rents a property for $270 per week in a known middle class area. \u00a0Sally has no spouse or dependents and has 5 credit card debts totalling $40,000.The administrator has only kept copy of the proposal and statement of affairs, signed prescribed information and a file note recording what was sighted and the information it contains.The information on Sally\u2019s proposal and statement of affairs is consistent and her salary and expenses reasonable and liabilities not excessive. \u00a0In this example, it is probably not essential to keep copies of all documentation. \u00a0With sound judgment and common sense, the administrator can form the view by viewing the rent agreement, pay slips and bank accounts/statements.The Inspector-General is likely to be satisfied if the evidence to that effect was a file note recording what was sighted and the information it contained. \u00a0There would not be an expectation to see a property search or other information regarding the house or the vehicle and the Inspector-General would not record any breach of certification duty.Example 2 \u2013 Unacceptable retention of documentationJimmy is a high-profile debtor with a proven track record of the capacity to earn a very high income, who is presently living in Toorak, Melbourne.\u00a0 Jimmy discloses his only income as a disability support pension. \u00a0He has 3 credit card debts totalling $40,000 and is supported by money provided by his family and by living in the family house.The administrator has kept a copy of the signed prescribed information, Centrelink notice, Jimmy\u2019s last tax return and bank statements. \u00a0The administrator believes they have properly certified.Clearly, these documents are not sufficient evidence upon which to base certification. \u00a0In this example , the Inspector-General would expect significantly more \u2013 the asking of more questions and more documentation regarding income from other sources, lifestyle expenses, debts disclosed, property, trusts etc. \u00a0Such documentation would need to be retained on the administrator\u2019s file so the Inspector-General can be assured that adequate investigations were undertaken in order to properly certify.\n\n",

sees an administrator\u2019s advertisement and makes contact with them. \u00a0Jenny is taken through each part of the prescribed information and disclosure requirements (stage 1 information \u2013 seepart 3above) by the administrator. \u00a0All options suitable to the debtor\u2019s circumstances are explored, not only the Part IX option. \u00a0One week later, the administrator takes the debtor through the prescribed information and additional information sheet (stage 2 information \u2013 seepart 3above). \u00a0The debtor asks questions of the administrator on parts that are not understood. \u00a0The administrator ensures the debtor understands each option and the consequences of each option, particularly in respect of the impact on credit records and NPII. \u00a0A signed copy of the prescribed information and any other information given is retained on the administrator\u2019s file. \u00a0The administrator retains call records and file notes of their discussion on the same day.Example 4 \u2013 Unacceptable certificationNikul makes contact with the administrator. \u00a0He is then referred to a broker who does not explain Nikul\u2019s options to him. \u00a0The broker insists that a debt agreement is the best and only alternative. \u00a0Nikul is advised to \u201csign here\u201d on the prescribed information, and is told \u201cit is only paperwork\u201d. \u00a0The prescribed information is not retained on the administrator\u2019s file; rather, it is filed with the Official Receiver.Affordability and sustainabilityExample 5 \u2013 Acceptable certificationRowan is 21 years old and earning $30,000 per annum. \u00a0He has no spouse, no children and is living at home with his parents. \u00a0He has unsecured debts of $30,000. \u00a0After performing a review of Rowan\u2019s lifestyle, past spending habits and future plans, the budget prepared by the administrator reveals a weekly surplus of $150. \u00a0Rowan proposes to pay creditors $100 per week for a period of 3 years.The administrator retains a copy of Rowan\u2019s payslip and a file note detailing what documents were sighted. \u00a0The administrator certifies that the proposal is affordable and sustainable.Example 6 \u2013 Unacceptable certificationLara is married with one child and earns $65,000 per annum, with \u00a0half of her salary is based on commission. \u00a0Lara\u2019s total unsecured debts are $50,000. \u00a0Her spouse does not work and the child is enrolled in private high school at which she will commence in one month. \u00a0Lara has had persistent health concerns over the last 5 years, some requiring hospitalisation. \u00a0Her family does not have private health insurance.The budget prepared by the administrator reveals a weekly surplus of $200. \u00a0Lara proposes to pay creditors $195 per week for a period of 3 years.No documentation is retained to evidence what investigations were carried out and what documentation was sighted. \u00a0The administrator certifies that the proposal is affordable and sustainable.This is clearly an example of unacceptable certification as the proposal is neither affordable nor sustainable. \u00a0The impact of a salary dependent upon commission in light of the debtor\u2019s health concerns and likely absence from work casts doubt on this element of the certification. \u00a0Further, there is no evidence of supplementary income to support the proposal and, with the impending increase in expenses through the child\u2019s enrolment in a private school, the proposal is clearly not sustainable.Upon inspection, it is likely that the Inspector-General will record this matter as a breach of certification duty, investigate to discover if the breach is systemic and, if appropriate, will supervise the implementation of a change in practice to ensure instances like this do not recur.Full disclosureExample 7 \u2013 DisclosureKimiko is a consultant to a law firm earning $75,000 per annum. \u00a0She owns a house in Sydney worth $600,000 with $550,000 owing on the mortgage. \u00a0She also owns a one year old vehicle that she values at $75,000, with $70,000 owing to a secured creditor. \u00a0Kimiko\u2019s unsecured debts total $65,000, although she is unsure about a potential liability to the Australian Taxation Office (\u201cATO\u201d).Acceptable certificationThe administrator verifies through freely-available property websites that the value of Kimiko\u2019s house is more in the vicinity of $750,000. \u00a0A phone call from the administrator to a local real estate agent confirms the value as approximately $750,000. \u00a0The mortgagee confirms with the administrator that their current debt is actually $450,000.The administrator verifies through freely-available vehicle websites that the vehicle\u2019s value is approximately $60,000. \u00a0The secured creditor confirms with the administrator that the current debt is actually $70,000.The administrator reviews the debtor\u2019s prior year tax returns and assessments and discovers that there is an outstanding liability to ATO of $75,000.Taking into account the above points, it is clear both the asset and liability threshold amounts for a debt agreement have been exceeded. \u00a0The administrator correctly decides not to proceed any further with the proposal. \u00a0Kimiko is again made aware of her options and referred to appropriate other sources of assistance.Unacceptable certificationThe administrator is unaware of property values in the area of Sydney in which Kimiko owns her house. \u00a0The administrator assumes that the information Kimiko providedregarding her house value of $600,000 is correct and performs no independent verification of the value nor confirms the current indebtedness to the mortgagee. \u00a0Similarly, the administrator performs no independent verification of the value of the vehicle nor confirms the amount owing to the secured creditor. \u00a0With respect to the potential debt owing to the ATO, the administrator performs no independent verification and decides that in light of the uncertainty the amount owing to ATO should be disclosed in the proposal as $1.Taking into account the above points, the administrator certifies that the debtor has made full and accurate disclosure of all assets and liabilities.This is an example of certifying in breach of the Bankruptcy Act and, upon inspection, Practitioner Surveillance would take issue with the administrator as they have clearly breached their certification duty. \u00a0The severity of the action taken by Practitioner Surveillance will depend on whether this type of breach was found to be systemic.\n\n",

of the rulesA recommended initial remuneration notice (\u201cIRN\u201d) precedent for registered trustees of a regulated debtor\u2019s estate to use is shown inannexure A.Contents of the IRNThe IRNmustcontain the following information:a brief explanation of the types of methods that may be used to calculate remunerationthe method that the trustee proposes to use to calculate remuneration and explain why it is appropriatedetails of the rate of remunerationspecify an estimate of the expected amount of the trustee\u2019s remunerationspecify the method by which disbursements will be calculated.If the trustee chooses the time-cost basis method, the notice must include details about the respective rates at which the remuneration of the trustee and the other persons who will be assisting, or will be likely to assist, the trustee in the performance of their duties are to be calculated.[3]When choosing the most appropriate remuneration method and advising creditors of why that method was chosen, it is expected that trustees will consider factors such as cost effectiveness, efficiency and the level of debt and/or expected realisations in the regulated debtor\u2019s estate.Registered trustees are also expected to indicate in the IRN that determination by creditors will not be required if the total remuneration they expect to claim is less than the:maximum default

business days after the day the trustee receives the regulated debtor\u2019s statement of affairs.[10][11]If the trustee does not receive the bankrupt\u2019s statement of affairs within 60 days after the date of bankruptcy, the IRN must be sent within 7 days after the end of the 60-day period.[12]In the case of the trustee of a personal insolvency agreement (\u201cPIA\u201d), where that trustee was not also the controlling trustee in respect of the debtor executing the PIA, the IRN must be sent within 20 business days after the PIA is executed.[13]It is mandatory to provide the IRN to the regulated debtor and creditors in every regulated debtor\u2019s estate. \u00a0It does not matter if the estate has no money or that the registered trustee does not intend having creditors determine their remuneration.It is not necessary for the incoming trustee to send an IRN when there has been a change of trustee. \u00a0However, where the incoming trustee seeks to have their remuneration calculated in a manner that differs substantially from the outgoing trustee, the incoming trustee should consider whether a notice along the lines of the IRN should nevertheless be sent to creditors and the regulated debtor.There is no prescribed or approved form for this notice. Registered trustees are expected to take guidance from the recommended precedent inannexure A. \u00a0This has been modelled on information in the ARITA Code.What can affected parties do if dissatisfied with the IRN?If the regulated debtor or creditors are dissatisfied with the content of the IRN, they should first endeavour to resolve their concerns directly with the trustee. \u00a0If this does not result in a satisfactory outcome, they have the right to:request additional information from the trustee under Subdivisions E[14]or D[15]of Division 70 of the Scheduleseek a change of trustee by asking the trustee to convene a meeting under subsection 90-35(1) of the Schedulecomplain to AFSA.[16]\n\n",

claim notice (\u201cRCN\u201d) precedent for registered trustees to use is shown inannexure C.Contents of the RCNA regulated debtor or a creditor may elect to receive an RCN within 20 business days after receiving a RR. \u00a0If a regulated debtor or creditor elects to receive an RCN from the trustee it must include the following information:[20]the total amount of remuneration claimed by the trusteedetails of the work performed for which the remuneration is claimeddetails of the method of calculating the amount of remuneration claimeddetails of the amount of disbursements claimeddetails of the method of calculating the amount of disbursements claimedan explanation of any variation from the amounts set out in the RAR in relation to the remuneration claimed and the method of calculating the amount of remuneration claimeda statement advising the regulated debtor and the creditors that they may, within 20 business days after receiving the notice, request the Inspector-General to review the amount of remuneration claimed by the trustee.The term \u201cclaimed\u201d refers to the right and ability to draw now or at a future date. \u00a0In practice, it will be more than likely that regulated debtor\u2019s estate has to have money in it as a precursor to sending an RCN. \u00a0One of the primary purposes of sending an RCN is to inform the regulated debtor and creditors of their right of review if they are dissatisfied with the trustee\u2019s claim for remuneration. \u00a0This dissatisfaction will only have a material effect and be capable of a practical outcome if the trustee has realised sufficient money to pay themself the remuneration in dispute. \u00a0However, it will be open to trustees to send the RCN before there is actually money in the estate to satisfy the remuneration claim, so long as the work for which they are claiming has been undertaken.It is important that any variation in the amount taken in remuneration or disbursements from the amount originally determined by creditors in the RAR is clearly explained to the satisfaction of the regulated debtor and creditors. \u00a0In other words, the trustee has an obligation to explain why what they took in remuneration or disbursements is inconsistent with or different to the prior determination made. \u00a0It is only variations that affect the amounts set out in the RAR that need to be explained. \u00a0For example, a variation that need not be explained in the RCN is where an employee of the trustee is replaced by another employee at the same classification and their services are charged out at the same hourly rate.It is expected that each RCN is accompanied by either aForm 2 \u2013 Trustee\u2019s Accounts of Receipts and Paymentsor receipts and payments summary in the estate so the bankrupt and creditors can compare the value of receipts that have been taken in remuneration and other items. \u00a0If the regulated debtor or a creditor(s) is seeking to gain further information about the trustee\u2019s remuneration, it is expected that trustees will promptly send to them a detailed work-in-progress (\u201cWIP\u201d) and certainly no later than 5 business days of the request being made, or such later time as the trustee may agree with the person making the request \u2013 this is a requirement of section 70-1 of the Rules. \u00a0A WIP is a detailed schedule of the time spent and work performed by the trustee and their staff in the administration of the estate.The RCN should refer back to the relevant RAR and clearly state the total remuneration previously determined.Guidance on how to request the Inspector-General to review the trustee\u2019s remuneration is provided inReviewing remuneration of trustees and costs of third party service providers.When to send the RCNIf a regulated debtor or a creditor has elected to receive a RCN and the total remuneration claimed by the trustee is greater than the maximum default amount, the trustee must give them a RCN before finalising the administration.[21]The term \u201cfinalising the administration\u201d has a meaning consistent with subsection 145(1) of the Bankruptcy Act. \u00a0That is, this occur when the trustee has realised all property of the bankrupt or debtor, or so much of it as can, in their opinion, be realised without needlessly protracting the administration. \u00a0In the course of trustee inspections, dealing with complaints and remuneration review requests, AFSA will monitor this requirement to ensure the RCN is sent as soon as practical.Where it is determined that a trustee has needlessly drawn out the finalisation of an estate by not actioning appropriate tasks in a timely manner or not determining that a dividend will be declared when in a position to do so, AFSA will require an explanation from the trustee. \u00a0Depending on the response from the trustee, AFSA may take disciplinary action against the trustee as deemed appropriate on a case by case basis and in accordance withRegulation of bankruptcy trustees and debt agreement administratorsandInvoluntary cancellation of trustee registration.There is no prescribed or approved form for the RCN. \u00a0Registered trustees are expected to take guidance from the recommended precedent shown inannexure C. \u00a0This has been modelled on information in the ARITA Code.What can affected parties do if dissatisfied with the RCN?If the regulated debtor or a creditor(s) is dissatisfied with the trustee\u2019s remuneration claim contained in the RCN, they have

automatically cancel the registration of a registered trustee if the registered trustee dies or becomes an insolvent under administration. \u00a0The cancellation will take effect on the day of either event occurring.The Inspector-General may suspend or cancel the registration of a registered trustee if:the trustee is disqualified from managing corporations under Part 2D.6 of theCorporations Act 2001or under a law of an external territory or a law of a foreign countrythe trustee ceases to have adequate and appropriate professional indemnity or fidelity insurance against the liabilities that

Schedule that the trustee repay remuneration, the trustee has failed to repay the remunerationthe trustee has been convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonestythe trustee lodges a request with the Inspector-General in the approved form to have their registration suspended.AFSA also has the power to give a direction to a registered trustee not to accept further appointments. \u00a0The direction given will be in writing for a period specified if:the trustee has failed to comply with a direction given to the trustee under section 40-5 of the Schedule to remedy failure to lodge documents, or give information or documentsthe trustee has failed to comply with a direction given to the trustee under 40-10 of the Schedule to correct inaccuracies in information given to the Inspector-Generalthe trustee has failed to comply with a direction given to the trustee under section 70-70 of the Schedule to give relevant materialthe trustee has failed to comply with a direction given to the trustee under subsection 75-20(1) or (2) of the Schedule to convene a meeting of creditors or comply with requirements in relation to such a meeting.Disciplinary action with a committee processDivision 40-40 of the Schedule states that the Inspector-General may ask a registered trustee to provide a written explanation why the trustee should continue to be registered, if the Inspector-General believes that:the trustee no longer has the qualifications, experience, knowledge and abilities prescribed by the Rulesthe trustee has committed an act of bankruptcy within the meaning of the Act or a corresponding law of an external territory or a foreign countrythe trustee is disqualified from managing corporations under Part 2D.6 of theCorporations Act 2001, or under a

foreign country) the duties of an administrator in relation to a debt agreementthe trustee is not a fit and proper personthe trustee is not resident in Australia or in another prescribed countrythe trustee has failed to comply with a standard prescribed by the Rules.If AFSA then forms the belief that a ground set out in section 40-40 of the Schedule is established and other sanctions are inappropriate or have had no positive effect, the delegate will formally write to the trustee outlining the breaches in detail, seeking the trustee\u2019s formal response as to why their registration should not be cancelled. \u00a0The trustee is given 20 business days to respond in writing.If the delegate does not receive an explanation within 20 business days or is not satisfied by the explanation, the delegate may convene a committee to consider whether the trustee should continue to be registered.Committee processThe committee must consist of the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy or delegate, a person appointed by the Minister and a registered trustee (registered for more than 5 years and nominated by ARITA). \u00a0To ensure impartiality no delegate of the Inspector-General involved in decisions up to the point of referral to a committee will act as delegate of the Inspector-General on the committee.The committee is required to make inquiries that are reasonable for the purpose of making an informed decision or that the chair believes are appropriate for the committee to have sufficient information to make the decision.A committee must observe natural justice. \u00a0This is explained in more detail below.A committee is not bound by any rules of evidence but may inform itself on any matter as it sees fit. \u00a0This means that the committee will not hear submissions on whether information provided is admissible in a Court of law or not. \u00a0Similarly, there is no right of objection to the questions being asked by the committee. \u00a0Questions will be asked of the trustee and the trustee can choose to answer or not. \u00a0The committee may proceed with its consideration of the matter irrespective of any refusal to answer.While it will usually consider all the supporting documents that formed the basis of decisions of the Inspector-General\u2019s delegate and the trustee\u2019s responses, the committee is not limited to just that information or the information that formed the basis of the prior decision to issue a show cause letter. \u00a0The committee can consider any information and form its own view in the matter.The committee will interview the trustee. \u00a0Details of the interview process are provided below.Once the committee has considered all the information it needs it will decide firstly whether one or more of the circumstances set out in section 40-40 of the Schedule exist and, if so, whether this is serious enough to impose conditions on, suspend or cancel the registration of the trustee or take other action allowed under section 40-55 of the Schedule (seeparagraph 4.27below).\u00a0If at any point the committee is satisfied there is no utility in continuing to consider a matter the committee may decide to terminate its consideration of the matter.The committee must provide reasons for its decision to both the trustee and the Inspector-General. \u00a0The Inspector-General must give effect to the committee\u2019s decision.The Schedule contains offences for improper use or disclosure by a committee member of information obtained during the committee process.The interview process and natural justiceOnce the Inspector-General or delegate has determined the makeup of the committee, the committee will meet in person or by phone to preliminarily consider the matter and how to proceed.The interview date, time and place will be arranged to meet the needs of the committee and the trustee.The trustee may choose to have legal representation at any point in the process.The interview is an inquisitorial process, not an adversarial one. \u00a0The process is to provide the trustee with an opportunity to further rebut or comment on the issues raised previously by the Inspector-General\u2019s delegate and to allow the committee to seek clarification on issues and ask questions concerning the trustee\u2019s administrations and practices.The trustee may make submissions both on the issue of the prior delegate\u2019s decision concerning the circumstances set out in section 40-40 of the Schedule and on appropriate sanctions that should be imposed by the committee, in the event that the committee also finds the relevant circumstances exist.Time will be allowed for such submissions and the trustee may introduce any further information either in writing or verbally and this includes any other parties who would like to put submissions on the trustee\u2019s behalf. \u00a0The trustee should advise the committee before the interview if there are any other people they wish to call.Usually before the interview, the trustee will be provided with all the information the committee has to allow the trustee to prepare a response. \u00a0However, as some information may not become available until the interview or afterwards this will not always be possible.The committee will, before making its decision, provide advice on the information it will rely upon and provide any subsequent information to the trustee obtained during or after interview and allow a reasonable time for the trustee to consider and respond.Should assertions be made about the character of the trustee by any party and the assertions form part of the information on which the committee will rely, the trustee will have a right under natural justice principles to cross examine the person who made the assertion.The decisionThe committee is required to keep minutes recording their meetings and decisions made and must use its best endeavours to make a decision within 60 days of the matter being referred.The committee has various decision options as set out in section 40-55 of the Schedule:that the trustee should continue to be registeredthat the trustee's registration should be suspended for a period, or until the occurrence of an event, specified in the decisionthat the trustee's registration should be cancelledthat the Inspector-General should direct the trustee not to accept any further appointments as trustee, or not to accept any further appointments as trustee during the period specified in the decisionthat the trustee should be publicly admonished or

out any of the functions or duties, or exercise any of the powers, of a trustee on their behalf (whether as employee, agent, consultant or otherwise) for a period specified in the decision of no more than 10 yearsthat the Inspector-General should publish specified information in relation to the committee's decision and the reasons for that decision.The Courts have historically held trustees\u2019 registrations in high regard and have been reluctant to de-register trustees unless the most serious breaches have occurred.\u00a0 Committees, whose decisions are reviewable in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, will consider any legal precedents which may provide guidance, in arriving at their decision.The committee report, to be provided to the trustee and Inspector-General, will outline the basis of the decision, detail the issues considered and the information and law relied upon.If the decision is to cancel registration, the trustee will not be entitled to a refund of all or part of any registration fee that has been paid. \u00a0The trustee would not be entitled to re-apply for registration for a period of 10 years.The Inspector-General is required by law to record certain

ineligibilityWhere a solicitor acting as a controlling trustee fails to carry out their duties or fails to co-operate with an inquiry or investigation, the Inspector-General can declare this person as

commencing cancellation processCancellation of registration is generally a sanction of last resort. \u00a0Such disciplinary action may be taken where a breach of the Bankruptcy Act is identified. \u00a0In deciding what action is appropriate, AFSA takes into account:the nature and circumstances of the breachthe seriousness of the effect of a failure to comply, including the impact on a particular administration or individualthe relevant prior conduct of the practitioner.Cancellation of an individual\u2019s or company\u2019s registrationSections 186K and 186L of the Bankruptcy Act state that the Inspector-General must cancel an individual\u2019s or a company\u2019s registration as a debt agreement administrator if the Inspector-General is satisfied that they no longer pass the basic eligibility test.AFSA may also issue a show cause letter, which asks for a written explanation about why the registration of an individual or company should continue if there are reasonable grounds to believe one of the following has occurred:the individual or company no longer has the ability (including the knowledge) to satisfactorily perform the duties of an administrator in relation to a debt agreementthe individual or company has failed to properly carry out the duties of an administrator in relation to a debt agreementthe individual no longer has the qualifications or experience prescribed by regulationsthe individual or the company no longer has adequate and appropriate professional indemnity and fidelity insurancean individual or the company is not a fit and proper person, or if any director of the company is not a fit and proper personan individual or the company has contravened a condition of registration, including contravention of an industry-wide condition that has been set by a ministerial legislative instrument.A company must ensure that it employs at least one registered administrator or registered trustee that has overall management responsibility for the company\u2019s debt agreement activities. \u00a0This is a condition of the company\u2019s registration.If these individuals have their registration cancelled, the condition of the company\u2019s registration will be breached and this will prompt commencement of the involuntary cancellation process for the company. \u00a0This process will commence with AFSA seeking an explanation about why the company should remain registered.Should the individual with overall management responsibility resign from their employment with the registered company administrator, the onus is on the individual and the company to notify the Inspector-General as soon as possible. \u00a0If a company continues to conduct debt agreement activities without a registered person in that position, the cancellation process will commence.If a director of a company becomes ineligible, any company of which the person is a director is also ineligible to act as an administrator and the company\u2019s registration must be cancelled. \u00a0Usually, the director will have knowledge of pending matters that may affect their eligibility and should take steps to remove themselves as director to avoid possible cancellation of the company\u2019s registration.Further information about the relevant considerations when determining whether a person is a fit and proper person can be

OR notices online allows trustees and their staff to:apply for various notices onlinesave incomplete applications and access them latergenerate duplicate applications where multiple notices are required in the same administrationaccess submitted applications.Each application for the issue of an Official Receiver notice must:clearly identify the bankrupt or debtorclearly identify the nominated notice recipient.

More than one address (for example, a residential address and a business address) can be provided, with the trustee indicating, if known, at which address service is most likely to be successfulcontain a draft notice Providing this electronically allows for any suggested amendments to be made directly to the draftwith reference to the type of notice being requested, provide the information outlined in the following sections of this practice statementbe accompanied by any supporting documentation that the Official Receiver may require in order to be satisfied that the notice should be issued.The online application process will prompt the trustee to provide responses specific to the requirements of each type of notice and to attach supporting documentation required by the Official Receiver when considering an application.Notice application feeA fee applies for the application for issue of a notice under section 77AA, 77C, 81A, 128E, 139ZL or 139ZQ of the Bankruptcy Act and a certificate under section 139ZN or 139ZR. Pursuant to clause 2.01 of theBankruptcy (Fees and Remuneration) Determination 2015, the fee is presently $480.Unless an alternative arrangement for payment has been agreed with the Inspector-General or the Official Receiver, payment must be made at the time of application. Payment can be made on account, by credit card or by Electronic Funds Transfer.The fee attaches to the service provided by the Official Receiver and to reimburse the Official Receiver for the time spent reviewing and responding to an application for issue of a notice.Where the Official Receiver requires additional documents and/or information to make a decision, the trustee will generally be given 90 days from the day of the application, after which they may have to reapply for the notice.Where a notice needs to be reissued, for example where a section 77C notice recipient fails to attend an examination or where it is later discovered that information relied upon in issuing a notice is incorrect, the fee will be payable again for the reissued notice.The fee also applies to the issue of amended section 139ZL and 139ZQ notices and to the issue of follow-up notices, such as a section 139ZN certificate following the issue of a section 139ZL notice and the issue of a section 139ZR certificate following the issue of a section 139ZQ notice.A reissued notice may be issued without attracting a fee where:there has been a minor correction to the notice ordered or suggested by the courtthere was a defect in the notice caused by the Official Receiver.Other circumstances raised by the trustee will be considered on a case-by-case basis, with the decision taking into account the time required by the Official Receiver to attend to the reissue of the notice.Neither the Bankruptcy Act nor the Bankruptcy (Fees and Remuneration) Determination make provision for the refund of the fee in any circumstances.There is no fee payable by the trustee for the issue of a section 77CA notice or an application for issue of a section 77CA notice.Costs and expenses of the Official ReceiverAny costs incurred by the Official Receiver in the exercise of powers in relation to a bankrupt estate are to be taken to be costs and expenses of the administration of the estate of the bankrupt, pursuant to section 163A of the Bankruptcy Act.In some instances, for commercial reasons, the Official Receiver may require a trustee to pay costs and expenses of the Official Receiver at the time the notice is issued (for example, costs of personal service, car hire, travel costs etc.). These will be discussed with the trustee prior to the notice being issued.The decision-makerPursuant to subsection 15(4) of the Bankruptcy Act, Official Receivers are able to delegate their authority to exercise powers contained within that Act to authorised employees ofAFSA. Given the potential effects of the exercise of these powers, the decision to delegate their exercise is considered carefully. The Official Receiver will take into account the experience of the delegates and the extent to which they have received training and/or been assessed as competent in the application of the Bankruptcy Act and this practice statement.As such, a reference in this practice statement to the Official Receiver also refers to a delegate of the Official Receiver.Where a delegate of the Official Receiver does exercise a power, the notice will clearly identify that person as a delegate.Discretionary powerThe Official Receiver is not compelled to issue a notice upon request. The power to issue a notice is discretionary and will be made after considering the information provided in the trustee\u2019s application and any additional information requested from the trustee.The effect of the exercise of the power to issue a notice other than on a sound basis can have a significant effect on the public perception of the role of the Official Receiver, the professional reputation of the trustee and the personal and business affairs of the notice recipient and other parties. Because of this, the decision to issue a notice must be soundly based and directly related to the performance of a trustee\u2019s duties under the Bankruptcy Act and at general law.Avoiding a conflict of interestA conflict of interest exists if the delegate of the Official Receiver has a personal interest in the outcome that may, or may appear, to prevent him or her from making a decision impartially. The delegate\u2019s personal interest may be financial or personal:What matters is not the nature of the interest but instead its actual or apparent influence on the [decision-maker\u2019s] ability to decide impartially.[1]The Australian Public Service (\u201cAPS\u201d) Code of Conduct and Values (contained in thePublic Service Act 1999) also provide that APS employees mustinter alia:disclose, and take reasonable steps to avoid, any conflict of interest (real or apparent) in connection with APS employmentnot make improper use of:inside informationthe employee\u2019s duties, status, power or authority, in order to gain, or seek to gain, a benefit or advantage for the employer or any other person.It is impossible to provide detailed rules identifying or governing every situation in which the exercise of the Official Receiver\u2019s powers may give rise to a conflict of interest. The most appropriate approach is to adopt the question suggested by the Administrative Review Council, namely:The question that should be asked is: would a member of the public who knew about this interest reasonably think that it might influence the decision?\u00a0 It is irrelevant that the decision-maker is personally satisfied that the conflicting interest has been put out of mind in arriving at a decision.\u00a0 The important thing is how the decision might appear to an observer.[2]In order to avoid the most obvious conflicts arising, AFSA has adopted a practice whereby employees administering bankrupt estates do not exercise the Official Receiver\u2019s powers covered in this practice statement in respect of estates they are administering.Where a real or apparent conflict does arise, the Official Receiver (or the delegate) must disclose it to the trustee applicant as soon as possible. The Official Receiver will make arrangements for another delegate to determine the application.Reasons for decisionIt is consistent with good administrative decision-making practices for written reasons to be prepared that support the exercise of the Official Receiver\u2019s powers.In the case of an application for issuance of a notice under section 77AA, 77C, 81A, 128E, 139ZL or 139ZQ of the Bankruptcy Act, the reasons for the decision to issue or not issue the notice will reference the evidence taken into account by the Official Receiver, including verbal evidence provided in any discussions with the trustee or the trustee\u2019s office.In the case of a section 77CA notice, the reasons for decision may be confined to the evidence provided by the trustee regarding the date the bankrupt was notified of their bankruptcy and their obligation to file a statement of affairs, together with the information available to the Official Receiver regarding the statement of affairs having not being filed within the statutory time period.\n\n",

            "Where a notice needs to be reissued, for example where a section 77C notice recipient fails to attend an examination or where it is later discovered that information relied upon in issuing a notice is incorrect, the fee will be payable again for the reissued notice.\n\nThe fee also applies to the issue of amended section 139ZL and 139ZQ notices and to the issue of follow-up notices, such as a section 139ZN certificate following the issue of a section 139ZL notice and the issue of a section 139ZR certificate following the issue of a section 139ZQ notice.\n\nA reissued notice may be issued without attracting a fee where:there has been a minor correction to the notice ordered or suggested by the courtthere was a defect in the notice caused by the Official Receiver.\n\nthere has been a minor correction to the notice ordered or suggested by the court\n\nthere was a defect in the notice caused by the Official Receiver.\n\nOther circumstances raised by the trustee will be considered on a case-by-case basis, with the decision taking into account the time required by the Official Receiver to attend to the reissue of the notice.\n\nNeither the Bankruptcy Act nor the Bankruptcy (Fees and Remuneration) Determination make provision for the refund of the fee in any circumstances.\n\nThere is no fee payable by the trustee for the issue of a section 77CA notice or an application for issue of a section 77CA notice.\n\nCosts and expenses of the Official Receiver\n\nAny costs incurred by the Official Receiver in the exercise of powers in relation to a bankrupt estate are to be taken to be costs and expenses of the administration of the estate of the bankrupt, pursuant to section 163A of the Bankruptcy Act.\n\nIn some instances, for commercial reasons, the Official Receiver may require a trustee to pay costs and expenses of the Official Receiver at the time the notice is issued (for example, costs of personal service, car hire, travel costs etc.). These will be discussed with the trustee prior to the notice being issued.\n\nThe decision-maker\n\nPursuant to subsection 15(4) of the Bankruptcy Act, Official Receivers are able to delegate their authority to exercise powers contained within that Act to authorised employees ofAFSA. Given the potential effects of the exercise of these powers, the decision to delegate their exercise is considered carefully. The Official Receiver will take into account the experience of the delegates and the extent to which they have received training and/or been assessed as competent in the application of the Bankruptcy Act and this practice statement.\n\nAs such, a reference in this practice statement to the Official Receiver also refers to a delegate of the Official Receiver.\n\nWhere a delegate of the Official Receiver does exercise a power, the notice will clearly identify that person as a delegate.\n\nDiscretionary power\n\nThe Official Receiver is not compelled to issue a notice upon request. The power to issue a notice is discretionary and will be made after considering the information provided in the trustee\u2019s application and any additional information requested from the trustee.\n\nThe effect of the exercise of the power to issue a notice other than on a sound basis can have a significant effect on the public perception of the role of the Official Receiver, the professional reputation of the trustee and the personal and business affairs of the notice recipient and other parties. Because of this, the decision to issue a notice must be soundly based and directly related to the performance of a trustee\u2019s duties under the Bankruptcy Act and at general law.\n\nAvoiding a conflict of interest\n\nA conflict of interest exists if the delegate of the Official Receiver has a personal interest in the outcome that may, or may appear, to prevent him or her from making a decision impartially. The delegate\u2019s personal interest may be financial or personal:\n\nWhat matters is not the nature of the interest but instead its actual or apparent influence on the [decision-maker\u2019s] ability to decide impartially.[1]\n\n",
            "What matters is not the nature of the interest but instead its actual or apparent influence on the [decision-maker\u2019s] ability to decide impartially.[1]\n\nThe Australian Public Service (\u201cAPS\u201d) Code of Conduct and Values (contained in thePublic Service Act 1999) also provide that APS employees mustinter alia:disclose, and take reasonable steps to avoid, any conflict of interest (real or apparent) in connection with APS employmentnot make improper use of:inside informationthe employee\u2019s duties, status, power or authority, in order to gain, or seek to gain, a benefit or advantage for the employer or any other person.\n\ndisclose, and take reasonable steps to avoid, any conflict of interest (real or apparent) in connection with APS employment\n\nnot make improper use of:inside informationthe employee\u2019s duties, status, power or authority, in order to gain, or seek to gain, a benefit or advantage for the employer or any other person.\n\ninside information\n\nthe employee\u2019s duties, status, power or authority, in order to gain, or seek to gain, a benefit or advantage for the employer or any other person.\n\nIt is impossible to provide detailed rules identifying or governing every situation in which the exercise of the Official Receiver\u2019s powers may give rise to a conflict of interest. The most appropriate approach is to adopt the question suggested by the Administrative Review Council, namely:\n\nThe question that should be asked is: would a member of the public who knew about this interest reasonably think that it might influence the decision?\u00a0 It is irrelevant that the decision-maker is personally satisfied that the conflicting interest has been put out of mind in arriving at a decision.\u00a0 The important thing is how the decision might appear to an observer.[2]\n\nThe question that should be asked is: would a member of the public who knew about this interest reasonably think that it might influence the decision?\u00a0 It is irrelevant that the decision-maker is personally satisfied that the conflicting interest has been put out of mind in arriving at a decision.\u00a0 The important thing is how the decision might appear to an observer.[2]\n\nIn order to avoid the most obvious conflicts arising, AFSA has adopted a practice whereby employees administering bankrupt estates do not exercise the Official Receiver\u2019s powers covered in this practice statement in respect of estates they are administering.\n\nWhere a real or apparent conflict does arise, the Official Receiver (or the delegate) must disclose it to the trustee applicant as soon as possible. The Official Receiver will make arrangements for another delegate to determine the application.\n\nReasons for decision\n\nIt is consistent with good administrative decision-making practices for written reasons to be prepared that support the exercise of the Official Receiver\u2019s powers.\n\nIn the case of an application for issuance of a notice under section 77AA, 77C, 81A, 128E, 139ZL or 139ZQ of the Bankruptcy Act, the reasons for the decision to issue or not issue the notice will reference the evidence taken into account by the Official Receiver, including verbal evidence provided in any discussions with the trustee or the trustee\u2019s office.\n\nIn the case of a section 77CA notice, the reasons for decision may be confined to the evidence provided by the trustee regarding the date the bankrupt was notified of their bankruptcy and their obligation to file a statement of affairs, together with the information available to the Official Receiver regarding the statement of affairs having not being filed within the statutory time period.\n\nSection 77AA \u2013 Access by the official receiver to premises and booksSection 77AA of the Bankruptcy ActSection 77AA entitles the Official Receiver to access all premises and books for any purpose of the Bankruptcy Act in relation to:a bankrupta debtor who is party to a debt agreementa debtor whose affairs are being administered under Part Xa deceased debtor whose estate is being administered under Part XI.Section 77AA can be exercised in relation to any premises and any books related to any purpose of the Bankruptcy Act, and not just to premises or books associated with the bankrupt, person, debtor or deceased debtor. This means that access can be obtained to the premises and books of third parties including government bodies, accountants, solicitors, relatives etc.Section 77AA provides the Official Receiver with a very significant and invasive power that must be exercised carefully. The Official Receiver will generally exercise this power only where it can be shown that:access to the books will assist the trustee to perform his or her functions under the Bankruptcy Actthere is evidence to suggest that the books are likely to be held on the premises to which access is soughtthere are no other available options to gain access to the books. This may include the occupier of the premises not being willing to provide the books voluntarily or the trustee demonstrating that making such a request to the occupier would lead to a real risk of the books being removed or destroyed.What the trustee must establish and provide in the applicationIn addition to the items listed in paragraph2.2above, when making an application for issue of a section 77AA notice the trustee will need to address and satisfy the following, which are outlined in more detail below.Is the notice being issued in connection with the trustee\u2019s role?The nominated notice recipient\u2019s association with or link to theWhat exactly the trusteeHave the alternatives been considered and/or exhausted?What reason is there to believe that the information, evidence and/or books sought under the notice exist at the relevant premises?If the requested notice is not the first notice, why is an additional notice required?Who the trustee wishes to have accompany him or her in the event that the notice is issued.a. Is the notice being issued in connection with the trustee\u2019s role?The trustee\u2019s application must confirm that the trustee has considered whether the requested notice and the books sought are relevant to the trustee\u2019s functions under the Bankruptcy Act.Example 1In a bankrupt estate, the purpose of a section 77AA notice is to assist the trustee in maximising returns to creditors. Therefore, use of the power to obtain information that may lead to property (including income contributions) being recovered for the benefit of creditors is generally appropriate.b. The notice recipientThe trustee\u2019s application must correctly identify the nominated notice recipient.A section 77AA notice can be issued to any person. The application must establish an association or link between the nominated notice recipient and the administration. The trustee must satisfy the Official Receiver that there is a reasonable belief that the nominated notice recipient has the books to which access sought.c. What exactly is sought?The application should provide an explanation of the books sought under the notice. The books sought, and therefore the explanation, must be as specific as possible.At the point at which the application for the notice is made, the trustee will have formed a view about what books exist and how these will assist the investigation to allow the trustee to provide a sufficiently exact description.Example 2A request for a notice to be issued pursuant to section 77AA for access to \u201call books and records relating to the affairs of the bankrupt\u201d does not provide sufficient information for the Official Receiver to facilitate issuance of a notice.Where the notice seeks access to books concerning an \u201cassociated entity\u201d of a bankrupt, it may be appropriate to provide a short table or explanation of how the entity is associated with the bankrupt. The trustee may wish to consider the application of sections 5B to 5E of the Bankruptcy Act to identify the nature of the relationship.d. Have the alternatives been considered and/or exhausted?The trustee must satisfy the Official Receiver that exercise of the power is necessary because other attempts to access or obtain the books have been, or are likely to be, unsuccessful. Where appropriate, the application should indicate whether statutory alternatives have been considered.Example 3A trustee may wish to consider whether a notice issued under section 77A or a demand under section 129 of the Bankruptcy Act will achieve the same outcome.The application is to indicate whether the nominated notice recipient has been contacted informally or formally prior to the issue of the notice to ascertain whether they will voluntarily provide the books sought or cooperate with the trustee. If this has not been done, the application must explain why not (for example, prior statements from the nominated notice recipient indicating no intention to cooperate or a history or obstruction, or there being a real risk of the books being removed or destroyed if they are requested).e. What reason is there to believe that the books sought under the notice exist at the relevant premises?The trustee\u2019s application will need to address the reason for believing that the books are in the possession of the nominated notice recipient (if the recipient is not the bankrupt) and/or they are held on the premises to which access is sought. The Official Receiver will not require the trustee to prove that the books exist but will require something more than a general suspicion \u2013 that is, the trustee will need to establish a sound basis for believing that the person has the books. For example, this may be based on the relationship between the person and the bankrupt. It may be necessary to provide more supporting information the further removed from the debtor the recipient is.Example 4It may be sufficient for the trustee to explain that the person was a business associate of the bankrupt at a relevant time or that the person was a family member who has knowledge of the bankrupt\u2019s affairs.f. If the requested notice is not the first notice, why is an additional notice required?If a notice(s) has already been issued to the same recipient, or a notice has already been issued to another recipient in relation to access to the same books presently sought, the trustee\u2019s application will need to explain why an additional notice is required.g. Persons accompanying the trusteeSubsection 77AA(1A) provides that the registered trustee who is administering the affairs of the bankrupt or debtor to whose affairs the books relate may accompany the Official Receiver when the section 77AA power is exercised. The Official Receiver must authorise attendance in writing.The Official Receiver generally expects the trustee to attend and will only refuse to allow the trustee to attend in exceptional circumstances, for example where the relationship between the trustee and the bankrupt has deteriorated to such an extent that the trustee\u2019s presence may impede the Official Receiver in exercising the right to full and free access.Subsection 77AA(1B) of the Bankruptcy Act permits the registered trustee to bring another person nominated by the trustee. It is generally not permissible for the Official Receiver to be accompanied only by the registered trustee\u2019s nominated person without the trustee also being personally present. The reasons for this are to recognise the significance of the power being exercised at the trustee\u2019s request and because it is appropriate in most cases that the trustee be present personally to support the justification for the Official Receiver exercising the power. (Note that, where there are to be separate section 77AA notices issued in the one administration and access to separate premises at the same time is to occur, the premises that the trustee attends will be discussed beforehand.)In order to ensure that the entitlement is exercised appropriately, and consistent with the nature of the notice being an exercise of the Official Receiver\u2019s power, the trustee\u2019s application must identify the person nominated by the trustee to attend and the reasons for their attendance.Prior arrangements regarding gaining access to premisesPrior to the execution of the notice, the trustee must alert the Official Receiver to potential difficulties in gaining access.\u00a0 These may include:the likelihood of any danger to the Official Receiver or accompanying persons during the visitany practical impediments to gaining accessan appropriate time to make the visit (for example, if a business premises, during opening hours).Where physical obstruction is expected or encountered, the Official Receiver or authorised officer may take whatever steps that are reasonably necessary and appropriate to remove that obstruction and gain access, for example by forcing open locks on doors.\u00a0 The power to gain full and free access must be used bona fide for the purposes for which it was conferred and should not be excessive in the circumstances of the case.[3]The Official Receiver shall restrain from gaining forced access where it is likely to put at risk the safety of the occupants of the premises and/or the safety of the persons accompanying the Official Receiver.The Official Receiver may require particular arrangements to be made to address these issues before the visit occurs.\u00a0 The trustee is required to meet the cost of such arrangements deemed necessary to exercise the power effectively. \u00a0Where possible, all arrangements are to be made before attendance at the premises occurs.Example 5The Official Receiver may request police attendance where any person may be in danger or where forced entry may be required.Where the property is unoccupied or unattended, a locksmith may be required. Where the information sought is likely to be available from a computer or database, a person with appropriate qualifications to replicate the database may be required.In addition to potential difficulties in the execution of the notice, the trustee should also give consideration to other matters, such as:whether it is appropriate to bring copying equipment to avoid the need to remove books from the premisesthe arrangements required to remove books from the premises.Accessing premisesWhen entering the premises, the Official Receiver or authorised officer must provide to the occupier evidence of the authority under which they are acting and proper photographic identification. Where a registered trustee accompanies the Official Receiver, the Official Receiver must provide to the occupier written authorisation for the trustee to be present. The trustee should also be prepared to provide appropriate identification. It will be helpful if the trustee has explained to the Official Receiver prior to the visit the types of books likely to be held on the premises.At all times during the visit, the trustee will assist the Official Receiver in identifying books to which access is sought. In particular, the trustee will assist the Official Receiver by identifying only those books that are relevant to the performance of the trustee\u2019s functions. However, as outlined below, a determination of which books will be removed and retained is a matter for the Official Receiver.Official Receiver\u2019s right to take copies of or extracts from books or to remove booksThe Official Receiver is permitted to take copies of or extracts from books. Where the books may be relevant to the examinable affairs of the bankrupt, person, debtor or deceased debtor, the Official Receiver may remove the books from the premises and may keep these until they are no longer required.Paragraph 77AA(1)(b) permits removal of the books from the premises if they relate to the examinable affairs of the bankrupt, person, debtor or deceased debtor. \u201cExaminable affairs\u201d is defined in section 5 of the Bankruptcy Act:\u201c\u2018examinable affairs\u2019, in relation to a person, means:(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the person\u2019s dealings, transactions, property and affairs; and(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the financial affairs of an associated entity of the person, in so far as they are, or appear to be, relevant to the person or to any of his or her conduct, dealings, transactions, property and affairs.\u201cIt is for the Official Receiver, and not the trustee, to decide whether the books may be relevant to the examinable affairs. If the Official Receiver does not think the books are relevant to the examinable affairs, they will not be removed, as the Bankruptcy Act does not provide for such books to be removed.Although the Official Receiver may, in the first instance, seek the consent of the occupant to remove the books, failure to provide this consent does not prevent removal of the books.Subsection 77AA(1C) allows the Official Receiver to remove books from the premises only where:it is not reasonably practicable to make copies of, or take extracts from, the books on the premises, orit would be an unreasonable intrusion on the affairs of the occupier of the premises to remain on the premises to make copies of, or take extracts from, the books.Example 6The Official Receiver may decide it is impractical to make copies of, or take extracts from, books on the premises where the volume of material to be copied makes it more efficient for this to occur elsewhereThe Official Receiver will provide the occupier with a receipt for all books removed from the premises.Official Receiver\u2019s right to keep booksSubsection 77AA(1D) of the Bankruptcy Act permits the Official Receiver to keep the books removed from the premises until it is decided that:the books are no longer needed, orthe books are not relevant to the examinable affairs of any bankrupt, person, debtor or deceased debtor.This right to keep books is in addition to the right to remove books from the premises for the purpose of making copies of or taking extracts from them.Where books have been removed from the premises, the Official Receiver will:determine as quickly as possible whether any of them are not Although the trustee may assist the Official Receiver in making this assessment, it is a matter for determination by the Official Receiverkeep them in the Official Receiver\u2019s possession until they are returned to the occupier or provided to the trusteebe responsible for ensuring the books are returned to the occupier in the same condition they were in when removed from the premises.Inspection of books being kept by the Official ReceiverSubsection 77AA(1E) of the Bankruptcy Act permits the owner of the books or the occupier of the premises to inspect them at any reasonable time. The Official Receiver considers \u201cat any reasonable time\u201d to mean during normal business hours.Books can be inspected at the place of business of the Official Receiver.The Official Receiver will allow this inspection as soon as possible following the making of a request for inspection.Returning books and recordsAs a general rule, the trustee who requested the Official Receiver to access the premises has no right to keep books but will be able to inspect them, make copies of and take extracts from them.However, if the books and records obtained belong to the bankrupt (that is, they are the \u201cproperty of the bankrupt\u201d), they should not be automatically returned to the bankrupt or occupier. The Bankruptcy Act provides that the trustee must take possession of all of the property of the bankrupt including \u201cdeeds, books and documents\u201d (subsection 129(1)).The Official Receiver will invite the trustee to identify those books that are claimed to be the bankrupt\u2019s property and should not be returned.Protection of information \u2013Privacy Act 1988TheAustralian Privacy Principles(\u201cAPPs\u201d) contained in thePrivacy Act 1988apply to the collection and maintenance of information obtained as a result of the exercise of this power. The Official Receiver is obliged to ensure that the information is not disclosed to a third party in a manner contrary to the Privacy Act.The information obtained through the exercise of section 77AA of the Bankruptcy Act will, in the first instance, be available to the trustee on whose application the power was exercised. The template for the notice to be issued under this section contains specific reference to the disclosure of this information for that purpose.Disclosure of the information to a person other than the trustee must be authorised by the Privacy Act.Claims of legal professional privilegeWhere the occupier of a premises subject to a section 77AA notice claims that the books sought are subject to legal professional privilege (LPP), notice recipient should prepare a schedule of the books using the headings listed below.Schedule headings:Item numberDate (if any)Author (if any)DescriptionPerson who claims privilegeBasis on which privilege is claimed.The notice recipient may then choose to:Withhold the books, keeping them safe under their custody or control. They must not be destroyed; orPlace the books (in hard copy, or on a USB or external hard-drive) into an envelope or container that should then be sealed and clearly marked as \u2018LPP\u2019. The sealed envelope or container should be delivered to the Official Receiver, along with the schedule. The Official Receiver will retain the documents in their sealed form until the conclusion of the matter. After this, they will be returned to the notice recipient.The Official Receiver cannot determine whether a claim for privilege is validly raised. If the claim is not conceded or accepted by the Trustee, then the Trustee or the recipient may apply to the Court to determine the claim.\n\n",

(Note that, where there are to be separate section 77AA notices issued in the one administration and access to separate premises at the same time is to occur, the premises that the trustee attends will be discussed beforehand.)\n\nIn order to ensure that the entitlement is exercised appropriately, and consistent with the nature of the notice being an exercise of the Official Receiver\u2019s power, the trustee\u2019s application must identify the person nominated by the trustee to attend and the reasons for their attendance.\n\nPrior arrangements regarding gaining access to premises\n\nPrior to the execution of the notice, the trustee must alert the Official Receiver to potential difficulties in gaining access.\u00a0 These may include:the likelihood of any danger to the Official Receiver or accompanying persons during the visitany practical impediments to gaining accessan appropriate time to make the visit (for example, if a business premises, during opening hours).\n\nthe likelihood of any danger to the Official Receiver or accompanying persons during the visit\n\nany practical impediments to gaining access\n\nan appropriate time to make the visit (for example, if a business premises, during opening hours).\n\nWhere physical obstruction is expected or encountered, the Official Receiver or authorised officer may take whatever steps that are reasonably necessary and appropriate to remove that obstruction and gain access, for example by forcing open locks on doors.\u00a0 The power to gain full and free access must be used bona fide for the purposes for which it was conferred and should not be excessive in the circumstances of the case.[3]The Official Receiver shall restrain from gaining forced access where it is likely to put at risk the safety of the occupants of the premises and/or the safety of the persons accompanying the Official Receiver.\n\nThe Official Receiver may require particular arrangements to be made to address these issues before the visit occurs.\u00a0 The trustee is required to meet the cost of such arrangements deemed necessary to exercise the power effectively. \u00a0Where possible, all arrangements are to be made before attendance at the premises occurs.\n\n",

Where the information sought is likely to be available from a computer or database, a person with appropriate qualifications to replicate the database may be required.\n\nIn addition to potential difficulties in the execution of the notice, the trustee should also give consideration to other matters, such as:whether it is appropriate to bring copying equipment to avoid the need to remove books from the premisesthe arrangements required to remove books from the premises.\n\nwhether it is appropriate to bring copying equipment to avoid the need to remove books from the premises\n\nthe arrangements required to remove books from the premises.\n\nAccessing premises\n\nWhen entering the premises, the Official Receiver or authorised officer must provide to the occupier evidence of the authority under which they are acting and proper photographic identification. Where a registered trustee accompanies the Official Receiver, the Official Receiver must provide to the occupier written authorisation for the trustee to be present. The trustee should also be prepared to provide appropriate identification. It will be helpful if the trustee has explained to the Official Receiver prior to the visit the types of books likely to be held on the premises.\n\nAt all times during the visit, the trustee will assist the Official Receiver in identifying books to which access is sought. In particular, the trustee will assist the Official Receiver by identifying only those books that are relevant to the performance of the trustee\u2019s functions. However, as outlined below, a determination of which books will be removed and retained is a matter for the Official Receiver.\n\nOfficial Receiver\u2019s right to take copies of or extracts from books or to remove books\n\nThe Official Receiver is permitted to take copies of or extracts from books. Where the books may be relevant to the examinable affairs of the bankrupt, person, debtor or deceased debtor, the Official Receiver may remove the books from the premises and may keep these until they are no longer required.\n\nParagraph 77AA(1)(b) permits removal of the books from the premises if they relate to the examinable affairs of the bankrupt, person, debtor or deceased debtor. \u201cExaminable affairs\u201d is defined in section 5 of the Bankruptcy Act:\n\n\u201c\u2018examinable affairs\u2019, in relation to a person, means:(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the person\u2019s dealings, transactions, property and affairs; and(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the financial affairs of an associated entity of the person, in so far as they are, or appear to be, relevant to the person or to any of his or her conduct, dealings, transactions, property and affairs.\u201c\n\n\u201c\u2018examinable affairs\u2019, in relation to a person, means:(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the person\u2019s dealings, transactions, property and affairs; and(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the financial affairs of an associated entity of the person, in so far as they are, or appear to be, relevant to the person or to any of his or her conduct, dealings, transactions, property and affairs.\u201c\n\nIt is for the Official Receiver, and not the trustee, to decide whether the books may be relevant to the examinable affairs. If the Official Receiver does not think the books are relevant to the examinable affairs, they will not be removed, as the Bankruptcy Act does not provide for such books to be removed.\n\nAlthough the Official Receiver may, in the first instance, seek the consent of the occupant to remove the books, failure to provide this consent does not prevent removal of the books.\n\n",
            "Subsection 77AA(1C) allows the Official Receiver to remove books from the premises only where:it is not reasonably practicable to make copies of, or take extracts from, the books on the premises, orit would be an unreasonable intrusion on the affairs of the occupier of the premises to remain on the premises to make copies of, or take extracts from, the books.\n\nit is not reasonably practicable to make copies of, or take extracts from, the books on the premises, or\n\nit would be an unreasonable intrusion on the affairs of the occupier of the premises to remain on the premises to make copies of, or take extracts from, the books.\n\nExample 6The Official Receiver may decide it is impractical to make copies of, or take extracts from, books on the premises where the volume of material to be copied makes it more efficient for this to occur elsewhere\n\nExample 6\n\nThe Official Receiver may decide it is impractical to make copies of, or take extracts from, books on the premises where the volume of material to be copied makes it more efficient for this to occur elsewhere\n\nThe Official Receiver will provide the occupier with a receipt for all books removed from the premises.\n\nOfficial Receiver\u2019s right to keep books\n\nSubsection 77AA(1D) of the Bankruptcy Act permits the Official Receiver to keep the books removed from the premises until it is decided that:the books are no longer needed, orthe books are not relevant to the examinable affairs of any bankrupt, person, debtor or deceased debtor.\n\nthe books are no longer needed, or\n\nthe books are not relevant to the examinable affairs of any bankrupt, person, debtor or deceased debtor.\n\nThis right to keep books is in addition to the right to remove books from the premises for the purpose of making copies of or taking extracts from them.\n\nWhere books have been removed from the premises, the Official Receiver will:determine as quickly as possible whether any of them are not Although the trustee may assist the Official Receiver in making this assessment, it is a matter for determination by the Official Receiverkeep them in the Official Receiver\u2019s possession until they are returned to the occupier or provided to the trusteebe responsible for ensuring the books are returned to the occupier in the same condition they were in when removed from the premises.\n\ndetermine as quickly as possible whether any of them are not Although the trustee may assist the Official Receiver in making this assessment, it is a matter for determination by the Official Receiver\n\nkeep them in the Official Receiver\u2019s possession until they are returned to the occupier or provided to the trustee\n\nbe responsible for ensuring the books are returned to the occupier in the same condition they were in when removed from the premises.\n\nInspection of books being kept by the Official Receiver\n\nSubsection 77AA(1E) of the Bankruptcy Act permits the owner of the books or the occupier of the premises to inspect them at any reasonable time. The Official Receiver considers \u201cat any reasonable time\u201d to mean during normal business hours.\n\nBooks can be inspected at the place of business of the Official Receiver.\n\nThe Official Receiver will allow this inspection as soon as possible following the making of a request for inspection.\n\nReturning books and records\n\nAs a general rule, the trustee who requested the Official Receiver to access the premises has no right to keep books but will be able to inspect them, make copies of and take extracts from them.\n\nHowever, if the books and records obtained belong to the bankrupt (that is, they are the \u201cproperty of the bankrupt\u201d), they should not be automatically returned to the bankrupt or occupier. The Bankruptcy Act provides that the trustee must take possession of all of the property of the bankrupt including \u201cdeeds, books and documents\u201d (subsection 129(1)).\n\nThe Official Receiver will invite the trustee to identify those books that are claimed to be the bankrupt\u2019s property and should not be returned.\n\nProtection of information \u2013Privacy Act 1988\n\n",

Is the notice being issued in connection with the trustee\u2019s role?The trustee\u2019s application must satisfy the Official Receiver that there is an association or link between the evidence and/or books sought and the performance of the trustee\u2019s functions, and that this is supported by evidence.Example 7In a bankrupt estate, the purpose of a section 77C notice is to assist the trustee in maximising returns to creditors.\u00a0 Therefore, use of the power to obtain information that may lead to property (including income contributions) being recovered for the benefit of creditors is generally appropriate.b. The nominated notice recipient\u2019s association with the administrationThe trustee\u2019s application and draft notice must correctly identify the person to whom it is to be given and set out precisely what the person must do to comply.A section 77C notice can be issued to any person. The application must establish an association or link between the nominated notice recipient and the administration of the estate. The trustee must satisfy the Official Receiver that there is a reasonable belief that the nominated notice recipient has the information, evidence and/or books to which access sought.c. What exactly is sought?The application is to provide an explanation of the information, evidence and/or books sought under the notice. The explanation is to be as specific as possible.At the point at which the application for the notice is made, the trustee will have formed a view about what information, evidence and/or books exist, how these will assist the investigation and how they relate to the functions of the trustee. This view formed will allow the trustee to provide a sufficiently exact description in the application.Example 8A request for a notice to be issued pursuant to section 77C for \u201call books and records relating to the affairs of the bankrupt\u201d does not provide sufficient information for the Official Receiver to determine whether the notice is properly issued.Where the notice seeks information concerning an \u201cassociated entity\u201d of a bankrupt, it may be appropriate to provide a short table or explanation of how the entity is associated with the bankrupt. The trustee may wish to consider the application of sections 5B to 5E of the Bankruptcy Act to identify the nature of the relationship.d. Have the alternatives been considered and/or exhausted?The trustee must satisfy the Official Receiver that exercise of the power is necessary because other attempts to obtain the information, evidence and/or books have been, or are likely to be, unsuccessful. The trustee\u2019s application must advise whether the nominated notice recipient has already been contacted informally or formally to ascertain whether the recipient will voluntarily provide material or cooperate with the trustee. Where appropriate, the application should indicate whether statutory alternatives have been considered.Example 9A trustee may wish to consider whether a notice issued under section 77A or a demand under section 129 of the Bankruptcy Act will achieve the same outcome.If this has not been done, the application must explain why not (for example, prior statements from the nominated notice recipient indicating no intention to cooperate, a history or obstruction or there being a real risk of the information, evidence and/or books being removed or destroyed if they are requested).The trustee will also need to satisfy the Official Receiver that the particular requirements to be included in the notice are necessary in the circumstances. For example, if the trustee requests a notice requiring a person to attend before the Official Receiver, the trustee will need to explain why the person cannot simply be required to provide information in writing.e. What reason is there to believe that the information, evidence and/or books sought under the notice exist?The trustee will need to explain to the Official Receiver the reason for believing that the information, evidence and/or books are available to or in the possession of the nominated notice recipient (if the recipient is not the bankrupt/debtor). The Official Receiver will not require the trustee to prove that the information, evidence and/or books exist but will require something more than a general suspicion \u2013 that is, the trustee will need to establish a sound basis for believing that the person has the information, evidence and/or books. This may be based on the relationship between the person and the bankrupt. It may be necessary to provide more supporting information the further removed from the bankrupt/debtor the recipient is.Example 10It may be sufficient for the trustee to explain that the person was a business associate of the bankrupt at a relevant time or that the person was a family member who has knowledge of the bankrupt\u2019s affairs.f. Requirements of the notice are not onerous or unreasonableThe application must satisfy the Official Receiver that the request is not onerous and/or unreasonable in nature.Where the notice requires attendance before the Official Receiver, the time and place to attend must be reasonable with regard to the person\u2019s circumstances (including, for example, whether the person will be required to travel to the appointed place).Where the notice requires the production of books, the trustee\u2019s application must satisfy the Official Receiver that the proposed timeframe for compliance with the notice is reasonable.g. If the requested notice is not the first notice, why is an additional notice required?If a notice(s) has already been issued to the same recipient, or a notice issued to another recipient in relation to access to the same books, information and/or presently sought, the trustee\u2019s application will need to explain why an additional notice is required.Section 77C notices \u2013 abbreviated processIt is not uncommon for large lending institutions or other organisations bound by the provisions of thePrivacy Act 1988to indicate that, while they are willing to cooperate with the trustee and provide the information requested, the provisions of the Privacy Act prevent them from doing so unless compelled by law. A trustee may be asked to obtain a notice to the institution pursuant to section 77C to compel the provision of the information.In these circumstances, it is unlikely that Official Receiver will demand a large volume of supporting information. It may be sufficient for the trustee\u2019s application to provide either an account of the discussion with the institution or a copy of a letter or other form of communication outlining the institution\u2019s position.Service of the noticeThe Official Receiver will attempt service of a notice on the nominated recipient in the first instance, using the address information provided by the trustee.Conduct of examinationsWhere a person is required to attend before the Official Receiver and give evidence, the Official Receiver will preside over the examination. The examination will usually be conducted at an AFSA office or, where this is not possible, another suitable location determined by the Official Receiver.The examination will generally be attended by the Official Receiver, the person being examined and the trustee. Other attendees at the examination are admitted at the discretion of the Official Receiver. The person being examined and the trustee are entitled to legal representation. Where necessary, the Official Receiver will allow the examination to be attended by interpreters and transcribers.Other parties may be permitted to attend only where there is a clear and compelling reason to conclude that their attendance will assist with the examination. For example, if there is any likelihood of an attendee disrupting or interfering with the examination or otherwise affecting the examination in such a way as to prevent the examinee providing full and frank answers, they will not be permitted to attend. If there is any likelihood that allowing a person to attend will affect the conduct of a later examination, the person will not be permitted to attend.Example 11Section 77C notices are issued to a bankrupt and her husband, requiring them to attend separate examinations and give evidence.Allowing the husband to attend the bankrupt\u2019s examination or the bankrupt to attend the husband\u2019s examination may disadvantage the trustee because any advantage to the trustee of putting the same questions to the bankrupt and her husband without an opportunity for them to discuss their answers will be lost.In this situation, the Official Receiver would give consideration to excluding the bankrupt\u2019s husband from attending the bankrupt\u2019s examination and excluding the bankrupt from the husband\u2019s examination.In conducting the examination, the Official Receiver willinter alia:ensure that the hearing is conducted in an orderly mannerconfine the hearing to the scope of the notice, having regard to the performance of the functions of the Official Receiver and the duties of the trustee pursuant to the Bankruptcy Actdisallow questions that are outside the scope of the notice or that constitute harassment.An adjournment of the examination for a short period may be permitted either on the Official Receiver\u2019s own motion or if one is sought by one of the parties to the examination (for example, a brief adjournment for personal comfort). The Official Receiver may also choose to place conditions on the adjournment. An adjournment is only available for a short period with the examination reconvened on the same day \u2013 adjournment to another day is not possible.An audio recording of the examination will be made by the Official Receiver in all cases. A copy of the recording and any notes taken by the Official Receiver will be provided to the examinee and the trustee.A transcript will not be provided unless either the trustee or the examinee has arranged for transcription services prior to the examination taking place or a person arranges for the recording to be transcribed after the examination. The cost of this will be borne by the party who arranged for the service.Notes taken by a person who attends before the Official Receiver and/or a copy of the transcript of evidence given by a person who attends are available for inspection by creditors for no fee and by members of the public on the payment of the applicable fee.Allowances and expenses in respect of attendanceSection 77D of the Bankruptcy Act provides that, where a person is required to attend before the Official Receiver under subsection 77C(1), the attendee is entitled to:an allowance of $22 (indexed)[4]for every day, or part thereof, that the attendee is required to attendto be reimbursed by the Official Receiver for any reasonable expenses incurred for transport, meals and accommodation in connection with the person\u2019s attendance.Where an attendee is entitled to an allowance and to be reimbursed for the above items, the Official Receiver must offer an advance for the allowance and expenses before the attendee begins to travel. \u00a0This offer is therefore included in the notice.The attendee may choose to accept an advance for travel costs or submit receipts to the Official Receiver for reimbursement post-attendance.\u00a0 The Official Receiver will determine if the claim is reasonable (subsection 77D(3)) and the bankrupt estate will bear the cost (section 77F).\u00a0 Consequently, the Official Receiver will contact the trustee\u2019s office to obtain a cheque for the required amount for forwarding to the attendee.Example 12An associated entity is required to attend before the Official Receiver and produce various books, including bank statements. To attend before the Official Receiver, the recipient is required to travel 150 kilometres by car to the relevant AFSA office. The recipient contacts the Official Receiver and requests an advance on their allowance and travel expenses. The Official Receiver then arranges for the recipient to be provided with a cheque for the specified amount, payable from the bankrupt estate.To minimise costs to the estate, if a person is required to physically attend before the Official Receiver and produce books, the Official Receiver may authorise an officer in another location to take receipt of those books.Example 13A business associate of a bankrupt is required to attend before the Official Receiver and produce books. The person resides in Hobart. The Official Receiver can authorise an officer in the Australian Financial Security Authority\u2019s Hobart office to receive the books.Although the Bankruptcy Act does not require a bankrupt to be given an allowance and travel expenses, the trustees should consider providing reasonable facilities to enable attendance. In these cases, as sections 77D and 77E do not apply, it is up to the trustee to come to an agreement with the bankrupt regarding reasonable expenses.Custody and return of booksWhere a notice requires the production of books, the Official Receiver will:issue a receipt for all booksretain the books and allow the trustee access to them to make copies ofrelevant materialreturn the books to the person as soon as they are no longer required (but see the following paragraph).If the books and records obtained belong to the bankrupt (that is, they are the \u201cproperty of the bankrupt\u201d), they should not be automatically returned. Subsection 129(1) of the Bankruptcy Act provides that the trustee must take possession of all of the property of the bankrupt including \u201cdeeds, books and documents\u201d. The Official Receiver will invite the trustee to identify those books that are claimed to be the bankrupt\u2019s property and should not be returned.Protection of information \u2013Privacy Act 1988TheAustralian Privacy Principles(\u201cAPPs\u201d) contained in thePrivacy Actapply to the collection and maintenance of information obtained as a result of the exercise of this power. The Official Receiver is obliged to ensure that the information is not disclosed to a third party in a manner contrary to that Act.The information obtained through the exercise of this power will, in the first instance, be available to the trustee on whose application the power was exercised. This disclosure is consistent with the operation of the APPs, being a use which is directly related to the purpose for which it was obtained (see APP6). The section 77C notice template used by the Official Receiver also contains specific reference to the disclosure of this information for that purpose.Disclosure of the information to a person other than the trustee must only be actioned if authorised by the Privacy Act.Example 14Although subsection 77C(3) of the Bankruptcy Act provides that a copy of the transcript of an examination is available for inspection by a member of the public for a fee, it does not provide that books and records obtained as a result of the exercise of this power are publicly available materials under the Bankruptcy Act.Accordingly, the disclosure of these materials to any person other than to the trustee is not authorised by lawClaims of legal professional privilegeWhere a claim of legal professional privilege (LPP) is made in relation to books that are required to be produced in accordance with a section 77C notice, notice recipient should prepare a schedule of the books using the headings listed below.Schedule headings:Item numberDate (if any)Author (if any)DescriptionPerson who claims privilegeBasis on which privilege is claimed.The notice recipient may then choose to:Withhold the books, keeping them safe under their custody or control. They must not be destroyed; orPlace the books (in hard copy, or on a USB or external hard-drive) into an envelope or container that should then be sealed and clearly marked as \u2018LPP\u2019. The sealed envelope or container should be delivered to the Official Receiver, along with the schedule. The Official Receiver will retain the documents in their sealed form until the conclusion of the matter. After this, they will be returned to the notice recipient.The Official Receiver cannot determine whether a claim for privilege is validly raised. If the claim is not conceded or accepted by the Trustee, then the Trustee or the recipient may apply to the Court to determine the claim.Failure to complySection 267B of the Bankruptcy Act provides for a penalty of imprisonment for 12 months for a person who, without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with a section 77C notice. The Official Receiver will refer all instances of non-compliance to the Inspector-General. The trustee does not need to also refer non-compliance.Section 267D also provides for a penalty of imprisonment for 6 months for a person who was required to attend before the Official Receiver and who failed to do so, where that person was provided with an advance and where the person does not have a reasonable excuse.Where a person has been required to attend before the Official Receiver and he or she fails to do so, the Official Receiver will consider referring the matter to the Inspector-General and/or seeking a warrant for arrest pursuant to section 267E of the Bankruptcy Act.Withdrawing noticesThe Official Receiver may, at any time, withdraw the notice. This will be considered:at the request of the trustee, orwhere the Official Receiver is satisfied that the notice should not have been issued.Defending noticesIf a dispute over the merits of a section 77C notice is unable to be resolved, the recipient of the notice is entitled to make application to the court to have it set aside. This may be by way of ordinary motion for review, such as under section 30 of the Bankruptcy Act.Whether it is the Official Receiver or the trustee who is principally responsible for responding to an application will depend on the nature of the notice.\n\n",

            "Example 8\n\nA request for a notice to be issued pursuant to section 77C for \u201call books and records relating to the affairs of the bankrupt\u201d does not provide sufficient information for the Official Receiver to determine whether the notice is properly issued.\n\nWhere the notice seeks information concerning an \u201cassociated entity\u201d of a bankrupt, it may be appropriate to provide a short table or explanation of how the entity is associated with the bankrupt. The trustee may wish to consider the application of sections 5B to 5E of the Bankruptcy Act to identify the nature of the relationship.\n\nd. Have the alternatives been considered and/or exhausted?\n\nThe trustee must satisfy the Official Receiver that exercise of the power is necessary because other attempts to obtain the information, evidence and/or books have been, or are likely to be, unsuccessful. The trustee\u2019s application must advise whether the nominated notice recipient has already been contacted informally or formally to ascertain whether the recipient will voluntarily provide material or cooperate with the trustee. Where appropriate, the application should indicate whether statutory alternatives have been considered.\n\nExample 9A trustee may wish to consider whether a notice issued under section 77A or a demand under section 129 of the Bankruptcy Act will achieve the same outcome.\n\nExample 9\n\nA trustee may wish to consider whether a notice issued under section 77A or a demand under section 129 of the Bankruptcy Act will achieve the same outcome.\n\nIf this has not been done, the application must explain why not (for example, prior statements from the nominated notice recipient indicating no intention to cooperate, a history or obstruction or there being a real risk of the information, evidence and/or books being removed or destroyed if they are requested).\n\nThe trustee will also need to satisfy the Official Receiver that the particular requirements to be included in the notice are necessary in the circumstances. For example, if the trustee requests a notice requiring a person to attend before the Official Receiver, the trustee will need to explain why the person cannot simply be required to provide information in writing.\n\ne. What reason is there to believe that the information, evidence and/or books sought under the notice exist?\n\nThe trustee will need to explain to the Official Receiver the reason for believing that the information, evidence and/or books are available to or in the possession of the nominated notice recipient (if the recipient is not the bankrupt/debtor). The Official Receiver will not require the trustee to prove that the information, evidence and/or books exist but will require something more than a general suspicion \u2013 that is, the trustee will need to establish a sound basis for believing that the person has the information, evidence and/or books. This may be based on the relationship between the person and the bankrupt. It may be necessary to provide more supporting information the further removed from the bankrupt/debtor the recipient is.\n\nExample 10It may be sufficient for the trustee to explain that the person was a business associate of the bankrupt at a relevant time or that the person was a family member who has knowledge of the bankrupt\u2019s affairs.\n\nExample 10\n\nIt may be sufficient for the trustee to explain that the person was a business associate of the bankrupt at a relevant time or that the person was a family member who has knowledge of the bankrupt\u2019s affairs.\n\nf. Requirements of the notice are not onerous or unreasonable\n\nThe application must satisfy the Official Receiver that the request is not onerous and/or unreasonable in nature.\n\nWhere the notice requires attendance before the Official Receiver, the time and place to attend must be reasonable with regard to the person\u2019s circumstances (including, for example, whether the person will be required to travel to the appointed place).\n\nWhere the notice requires the production of books, the trustee\u2019s application must satisfy the Official Receiver that the proposed timeframe for compliance with the notice is reasonable.\n\n",
            "g. If the requested notice is not the first notice, why is an additional notice required?\n\nIf a notice(s) has already been issued to the same recipient, or a notice issued to another recipient in relation to access to the same books, information and/or presently sought, the trustee\u2019s application will need to explain why an additional notice is required.\n\nSection 77C notices \u2013 abbreviated process\n\nIt is not uncommon for large lending institutions or other organisations bound by the provisions of thePrivacy Act 1988to indicate that, while they are willing to cooperate with the trustee and provide the information requested, the provisions of the Privacy Act prevent them from doing so unless compelled by law. A trustee may be asked to obtain a notice to the institution pursuant to section 77C to compel the provision of the information.\n\nIn these circumstances, it is unlikely that Official Receiver will demand a large volume of supporting information. It may be sufficient for the trustee\u2019s application to provide either an account of the discussion with the institution or a copy of a letter or other form of communication outlining the institution\u2019s position.\n\nService of the notice\n\nThe Official Receiver will attempt service of a notice on the nominated recipient in the first instance, using the address information provided by the trustee.\n\nConduct of examinations\n\nWhere a person is required to attend before the Official Receiver and give evidence, the Official Receiver will preside over the examination. The examination will usually be conducted at an AFSA office or, where this is not possible, another suitable location determined by the Official Receiver.\n\nThe examination will generally be attended by the Official Receiver, the person being examined and the trustee. Other attendees at the examination are admitted at the discretion of the Official Receiver. The person being examined and the trustee are entitled to legal representation. Where necessary, the Official Receiver will allow the examination to be attended by interpreters and transcribers.\n\nOther parties may be permitted to attend only where there is a clear and compelling reason to conclude that their attendance will assist with the examination. For example, if there is any likelihood of an attendee disrupting or interfering with the examination or otherwise affecting the examination in such a way as to prevent the examinee providing full and frank answers, they will not be permitted to attend. If there is any likelihood that allowing a person to attend will affect the conduct of a later examination, the person will not be permitted to attend.\n\nExample 11Section 77C notices are issued to a bankrupt and her husband, requiring them to attend separate examinations and give evidence.Allowing the husband to attend the bankrupt\u2019s examination or the bankrupt to attend the husband\u2019s examination may disadvantage the trustee because any advantage to the trustee of putting the same questions to the bankrupt and her husband without an opportunity for them to discuss their answers will be lost.In this situation, the Official Receiver would give consideration to excluding the bankrupt\u2019s husband from attending the bankrupt\u2019s examination and excluding the bankrupt from the husband\u2019s examination.\n\nExample 11\n\nSection 77C notices are issued to a bankrupt and her husband, requiring them to attend separate examinations and give evidence.Allowing the husband to attend the bankrupt\u2019s examination or the bankrupt to attend the husband\u2019s examination may disadvantage the trustee because any advantage to the trustee of putting the same questions to the bankrupt and her husband without an opportunity for them to discuss their answers will be lost.In this situation, the Official Receiver would give consideration to excluding the bankrupt\u2019s husband from attending the bankrupt\u2019s examination and excluding the bankrupt from the husband\u2019s examination.\n\nIn conducting the examination, the Official Receiver willinter alia:ensure that the hearing is conducted in an orderly mannerconfine the hearing to the scope of the notice, having regard to the performance of the functions of the Official Receiver and the duties of the trustee pursuant to the Bankruptcy Actdisallow questions that are outside the scope of the notice or that constitute harassment.\n\n",

The Official Receiver may also choose to place conditions on the adjournment. An adjournment is only available for a short period with the examination reconvened on the same day \u2013 adjournment to another day is not possible.\n\nAn audio recording of the examination will be made by the Official Receiver in all cases. A copy of the recording and any notes taken by the Official Receiver will be provided to the examinee and the trustee.\n\nA transcript will not be provided unless either the trustee or the examinee has arranged for transcription services prior to the examination taking place or a person arranges for the recording to be transcribed after the examination. The cost of this will be borne by the party who arranged for the service.\n\nNotes taken by a person who attends before the Official Receiver and/or a copy of the transcript of evidence given by a person who attends are available for inspection by creditors for no fee and by members of the public on the payment of the applicable fee.\n\nAllowances and expenses in respect of attendance\n\nSection 77D of the Bankruptcy Act provides that, where a person is required to attend before the Official Receiver under subsection 77C(1), the attendee is entitled to:an allowance of $22 (indexed)[4]for every day, or part thereof, that the attendee is required to attendto be reimbursed by the Official Receiver for any reasonable expenses incurred for transport, meals and accommodation in connection with the person\u2019s attendance.\n\nan allowance of $22 (indexed)[4]for every day, or part thereof, that the attendee is required to attend\n\nto be reimbursed by the Official Receiver for any reasonable expenses incurred for transport, meals and accommodation in connection with the person\u2019s attendance.\n\nWhere an attendee is entitled to an allowance and to be reimbursed for the above items, the Official Receiver must offer an advance for the allowance and expenses before the attendee begins to travel. \u00a0This offer is therefore included in the notice.\n\nThe attendee may choose to accept an advance for travel costs or submit receipts to the Official Receiver for reimbursement post-attendance.\u00a0 The Official Receiver will determine if the claim is reasonable (subsection 77D(3)) and the bankrupt estate will bear the cost (section 77F).\u00a0 Consequently, the Official Receiver will contact the trustee\u2019s office to obtain a cheque for the required amount for forwarding to the attendee.\n\nExample 12An associated entity is required to attend before the Official Receiver and produce various books, including bank statements. To attend before the Official Receiver, the recipient is required to travel 150 kilometres by car to the relevant AFSA office. The recipient contacts the Official Receiver and requests an advance on their allowance and travel expenses. The Official Receiver then arranges for the recipient to be provided with a cheque for the specified amount, payable from the bankrupt estate.\n\nExample 12\n\nAn associated entity is required to attend before the Official Receiver and produce various books, including bank statements.

The Official Receiver then arranges for the recipient to be provided with a cheque for the specified amount, payable from the bankrupt estate.\n\n",
            "To minimise costs to the estate, if a person is required to physically attend before the Official Receiver and produce books, the Official Receiver may authorise an officer in another location to take receipt of those books.\n\nExample 13A business associate of a bankrupt is required to attend before the Official Receiver and produce books. The person resides in Hobart. The Official Receiver can authorise an officer in the Australian Financial Security Authority\u2019s Hobart office to receive the books.\n\nExample 13\n\nA business associate of a bankrupt is required to attend before the Official Receiver and produce books. The person resides in Hobart. The Official Receiver can authorise an officer in the Australian Financial Security Authority\u2019s Hobart office to receive the books.\n\nAlthough the Bankruptcy Act does not require a bankrupt to be given an allowance and travel expenses, the trustees should consider providing reasonable facilities to enable attendance. In these cases, as sections 77D and 77E do not apply, it is up to the trustee to come to an agreement with the bankrupt regarding reasonable expenses.\n\nCustody and return of books\n\nWhere a notice requires the production of books, the Official Receiver will:issue a receipt for all booksretain the books and allow the trustee access to them to make copies ofrelevant materialreturn the books to the person as soon as they are no longer required (but see the following paragraph).\n\nissue a receipt for all books\n\nretain the books and allow the trustee access to them to make copies ofrelevant material\n\nreturn the books to the person as soon as they are no longer required (but see the following paragraph).\n\nIf the books and records obtained belong to the bankrupt (that is, they are the \u201cproperty of the bankrupt\u201d), they should not be automatically returned. Subsection 129(1) of the Bankruptcy Act provides that the trustee must take possession of all of the property of the bankrupt including \u201cdeeds, books and documents\u201d. The Official Receiver will invite the trustee to identify those books that are claimed to be the bankrupt\u2019s property and should not be returned.\n\nProtection of information \u2013Privacy Act 1988\n\nTheAustralian Privacy Principles(\u201cAPPs\u201d) contained in thePrivacy Actapply to the collection and maintenance of information obtained as a result of the exercise of this power. The Official Receiver is obliged to ensure that the information is not disclosed to a third party in a manner contrary to that Act.\n\nThe information obtained through the exercise of this power will, in the first instance, be available to the trustee on whose application the power was exercised. This disclosure is consistent with the operation of the APPs, being a use which is directly related to the purpose for which it was obtained (see APP6). The section 77C notice template used by the Official Receiver also contains specific reference to the disclosure of this information for that purpose.\n\nDisclosure of the information to a person other than the trustee must only be actioned if authorised by the Privacy Act.\n\nExample 14Although subsection 77C(3) of the Bankruptcy Act provides that a copy of the transcript of an examination is available for inspection by a member of the public for a fee, it does not provide that books and records obtained as a result of the exercise of this power are publicly available materials under the Bankruptcy Act.Accordingly, the disclosure of these materials to any person other than to the trustee is not authorised by law\n\nExample 14\n\nAlthough subsection 77C(3) of the Bankruptcy Act provides that a copy of the transcript of an examination is available for inspection by a member of the public for a fee, it does not provide that books and records obtained as a result of the exercise of this power are publicly available materials under the Bankruptcy Act.Accordingly, the disclosure of these materials to any person other than to the trustee is not authorised by law\n\nClaims of legal professional privilege\n\n",
            "Where a claim of legal professional privilege (LPP) is made in relation to books that are required to be produced in accordance with a section 77C notice, notice recipient should prepare a schedule of the books using the headings listed below.\n\nSchedule headings:Item numberDate (if any)Author (if any)DescriptionPerson who claims privilegeBasis on which privilege is claimed.\n\nItem number\n\nDate (if any)\n\nAuthor (if any)\n\nDescription\n\nPerson who claims privilege\n\nBasis on which privilege is claimed.\n\nThe notice recipient may then choose to:Withhold the books, keeping them safe under their custody or control.

The sealed envelope or container should be delivered to the Official Receiver, along with the schedule. The Official Receiver will retain the documents in their sealed form until the conclusion of the matter. After this, they will be returned to the notice recipient.\n\nWithhold the books, keeping them safe under their custody or control.

The sealed envelope or container should be delivered to the Official Receiver, along with the schedule. The Official Receiver will retain the documents in their sealed form until the conclusion of the matter. After this, they will be returned to the notice recipient.\n\nThe Official Receiver cannot determine whether a claim for privilege is validly raised. If the claim is not conceded or accepted by the Trustee, then the Trustee or the recipient may apply to the Court to determine the claim.\n\nFailure to comply\n\nSection 267B of the Bankruptcy Act provides for a penalty of imprisonment for 12 months for a person who, without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with a section 77C notice. The Official Receiver will refer all instances of non-compliance to the Inspector-General. The trustee does not need to also refer non-compliance.\n\nSection 267D also provides for a penalty of imprisonment for 6 months for a person who was required to attend before the Official Receiver and who failed to do so, where that person was provided with an advance and where the person does not have a reasonable excuse.\n\nWhere a person has been required to attend before the Official Receiver and he or she fails to do so, the Official Receiver will consider referring the matter to the Inspector-General and/or seeking a warrant for arrest pursuant to section 267E of the Bankruptcy Act.\n\nWithdrawing notices\n\nThe Official Receiver may, at any time, withdraw the notice. This will be considered:at the request of the trustee, orwhere the Official Receiver is satisfied that the notice should not have been issued.\n\nat the request of the trustee, or\n\nwhere the Official Receiver is satisfied that the notice should not have been issued.\n\nDefending notices\n\nIf a dispute over the merits of a section 77C notice is unable to be resolved, the recipient of the notice is entitled to make application to the court to have it set aside. This may be by way of ordinary motion for review, such as under section 30 of the Bankruptcy Act.\n\nWhether it is the Official Receiver or the trustee who is principally responsible for responding to an application will depend on the nature of the notice.\n\nSection 77CA \u2013 power to obtain statement of affairsSection 77CA of the Bankruptcy ActThe Official Receiver has the power to issue a statutory notice pursuant to section 77CA requiring the bankrupt to file his or her statement of affairs.Non-compliance with a section 77CA notice can result in imprisonment for up to 12 months.It is noted that, from 8 December 2023, a new stand-alone statement of affairs form was introduced for use by individuals made bankrupt by a sequestration order. The introduction of the new form supports compliance with the Bankruptcy Act by ensuring bankrupts who were made bankrupt via a sequestration order are not submitting a debtor\u2019s petition.Registration of the sequestration orderFollowing the making of a sequestration order by the court, the petitioning creditor has an obligation to file a copy of the order with the Official Receiver within 2 business days.Following the filing of the sequestration order, the Official Receiver will register it on the National Personal Insolvency Index and advise the trustee of his or her appointment.Obligation to file a statement of affairsSection 54 of the Bankruptcy Act requires a person who is made bankrupt by a sequestration order of the court to complete a statement of affairs and file it with the Official Receiver within 14 days of the person being notified of the bankruptcy. The bankrupt is also required to provide a copy of the statement of affairs to the trustee.As the completed statement of affairs facilitates the administration of the bankrupt estate by the trustee, it is important that the document is filed as soon as possible after the sequestration order is made, but not later than the 14 days permitted by legislation.Where a bankruptcy has been created as a result of a sequestration order, discharge from bankruptcy occurs at the earliest 3 years and 1 day from the day that an accepted statement of affairs has been filed with the Official Receiver, although this period can be extended (seeOfficial Trustee Practice Statement 5 \u2013 Objections to\u00a0discharge from bankruptcy). It is therefore in the bankrupt\u2019s interest to file the document as soon as possible to ensure that his or her discharge from bankruptcy is not affected by failure to file the statement of affairs on time.Failure of the bankrupt to file a statement of affairs is an offence of strict liability that, upon prosecution and conviction, can result in 50 penalty units being imposed.The trustee is responsible for locating the bankrupt and notifying him or her of the bankruptcy and of the obligation to file a statement of affairs with the Official Receiver.Filing of a statement of affairsWhere a statement of affairs is lodged by the bankrupt, the document is assessed by the Official Receiver. It is open to the Official Receiver to refuse a statement of affairs if it is determined that the statement of affairs is not adequate. Refer toOfficial Receiver Practice Statement 3 \u2013 Bankruptcy by sequestration order.When the statement of affairs is overdueWhere a sequestration order has been registered and a statement of affairs has not been filed by the bankrupt within a reasonable period from the date of the order, the Official Receiver will write to the trustee seeking certain information about the estate.However, trustees do not have to await contact by the Official Receiver and may request a section 77CA notice as soon as there is sufficient evidence available to establish that the bankrupt was notified of his or her obligation to file a statement of affairs, at least 14 days have passed since the bankrupt was notified and the bankrupt has not complied.The trustee can request issuance of a section 77CA notice online.What the trustee must establishIn addition to the items listed in paragraph2.2above, the trustee\u2019s application will need to include:confirmation that the bankrupt has been advised of the bankruptcy and of his or her obligation to file a statement of affairsinformation about the bankrupt\u2019s address and/or other relevant information (for example, details of the bankrupt\u2019s place of employment if the bankrupt is unable to be contacted at his or her usual place of residence).Any information provided by the trustee in response to the letter from the Official Receiver is assessed in order to determine whether a section 77CA notice should be issued to the bankrupt requiring him or her to file a statement of affairs.When a notice may not be issuedThe Official Receiver may decide not to issue the notice if:the trustee has not advised the bankrupt of the bankruptcy and of the obligation to file a statement of affairsthe trustee is unable to confirm the bankrupt\u2019s current addressthe sequestration order has been stayed by the court.Service of the noticeThe Official Receiver will attempt service of a notice on the bankrupt in the first instance, using the address information provided by the trustee.Following the Official Receiver\u2019s attempted service on the bankrupt and if the bankrupt cannot be located at the address provided by the trustee, the Official Receiver will advise the trustee that no further action can be taken until an alternative confirmed address is provided. Should the trustee subsequently provide additional information, such as a new address for service, the Official Receiver will consider issuing a new notice.Monitoring compliance with a section 77CA noticeThe Official Receiver will monitor compliance by the bankrupt with reference to the date the bankrupt was served with the notice.The bankrupt has 14 days from the date of receipt of the notice to file a statement of affairs with the Official Receiver. Failure to comply with the notice is an offence punishable by imprisonment for 12 months (pursuant to section 267B of the Bankruptcy Act).Where the bankrupt fails to comply with the section 77CA notice, the Official Receiver will refer the non-compliance to the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy (via AFSA\u2019s Enforcement and Practitioner Supervision division) for further investigation and consideration regarding prosecution action. The trustee is not required to also refer non-compliance with section 54 of the Bankruptcy Act where the Official Receiver has already referred non-compliance with a section 77CA notice.

Its purpose is to allow a trustee who has evidence of a void contribution to prevent the bankrupt dissipating an interest in a superannuation plan while investigations are continuing. Although the evidence required for the Official Receiver to issue a section 128E notice is less than that required to issue a section 139ZQ notice to recover the contribution, the trustee will need to satisfy the Official Receiver that there is a reasonable basis for believing that a void contribution has been made to the superannuation plan in question.What the trustee must establishIn addition to the items listed in paragraph2.2above, the trustee\u2019s section 128E notice application must include the following evidence:that a contribution made to the superannuation plan in question is void under section 128B or 128C and the trustee demonstrates that action is underway to apply for a notice under section 139ZQ, orthe trustee has commenced action under section An application under section 139ZU will identify the superannuation interest from which the trustee is attempting to recover a void contribution.

The Official Receiver is not bound to follow the trustee\u2019s wishes but will take these into account in determining whether it is appropriate to grant consent. The purpose of consultation is to determine whether granting consent will result in a risk that the contribution cannot be recovered.The Official Receiver will normally give consent where:the request is only in relation to the amount by which the member\u2019s interest exceeds the value of the void contributionsthe member wishes to roll over the interest for investment reasons and advises the Official Receiver of the details of the new fund (which will allow a fresh freezing notice to be issued in relation to that new fund)it appears that the trustee will be able to pay all creditors.Service of the noticeWhen an account freezing notice is issued, the Official Receiver must give a copy to the superannuation fund trustee and two copies to the trustee of the bankrupt estate.

            "Section 139ZL \u2013 requirement to pay money to discharge a bankrupt\u2019s liability to pay income contributionsSection 139ZL of the Bankruptcy ActSection 139ZL allows the Official Receiver to issue a notice for the recovery of income contributions payable by a bankrupt. A notice can also be issued in relation to a discharged bankrupt whose income contribution liability remains unpaid.The Official Receiver will only consider issue of a section 139ZL notice where the bankrupt has been notified of his or her liability. It is also preferred that the bankrupt has then been given an opportunity to comply with a payment due date or payment schedule set by the trustee before an application is made for the issue of a notice.What the trustee must establishIn addition to the items listed in paragraph2.2above, when making an application for issue of a section 139ZL notice the trustee will need to address and satisfy the following, which are outlined in more detail below.The bankrupt has an income contribution liability and has been notified of the liability and the payment due date or schedule.The total amount payable under the notice does not exceed the total liability.The nominated notice recipient is covered by section 139ZL of the Bankruptcy Act.What is required of the nominated notice recipient and the time for compliance are reasonable.The bankrupt\u2019s address.a. The bankrupt has a liability, has been notified of the liability and has been notified of the payment due date or payment scheduleThe trustee is to provide details of the bankrupt\u2019s total contribution liability, the amount (if any) paid to date and the payment due date or payment schedule.Details of when the bankrupt was advised of the liability and the payment schedule or payment due date must be provided.b. Total amount payable under the noticeThe amount claimed in the notice cannot exceed the total amount payable by the bankrupt for the contribution assessment period(s) assessed to date.The amount to be paid under the notice can include the total outstanding liability and not just the amount of the arrears (subsection 139ZL(3)).Example 15Where a bankrupt with a $10,000 liability for contribution assessment period 1 has paid $2000 to date and is $3000 in arrears with reference to the most recent payment schedule set by the trustee, and where the other necessary criteria for issuance of the notice have been satisfied, the notice can require the recipient to pay the remaining $8000 to the trustee (and not just the $3000 arrears amount).Pursuant to section 40 of theBankruptcy Regulations 2021, the trustee must confirm that the amount claimed in the notice is not protected money or property.c. Person to whom notice may be givenThe trustee must establish that the nominated notice recipient is a person to whom section 139ZL of the Bankruptcy Act applies.\u00a0 The notice must be able to be issued against a nominated, identifiable person by name or by title and must be issued to a third party (that is, someone other than the bankrupt).Notice recipients covered by section 139ZL include a person:from whom any money is due or accruing, or may become due, to a bankruptwho holds, or may subsequently hold, money for or on account of a bankruptwho holds, or may subsequently hold, money on account of some other person for payment to or on behalf of a bankruptwho has authority from some other person to pay money to or on behalf of a bankruptwho is liable to pay money or transfer property wholly or principally in consideration of personal services supplied by a bankrupt after the commencement of the bankruptcy, whether the services were supplied to the first-mentioned person or to some other personwho has received money or property wholly or principally in consideration of personal services supplied by a bankrupt after the commencement of the bankruptcy, whether the services were supplied to the first-mentioned person or to some other person.Common examples of such a person are the bankrupt\u2019s employer or a bank at which the bankrupt holds money.\u00a0 Notices may also be issued to the Australian Taxation Office in relation to tax refunds that would otherwise be due to the bankrupt or former bankrupt.d. What is required of the nominated notice recipient and the time for compliance are reasonableThe trustee\u2019s application must state precisely what the notice recipient must do to comply with the notice. This includes details of the total amount payable to the trustee, the method of payment and the date(s) of payment(s) to be made.The notice must provide the nominated recipient with a reasonable time period in which to comply. For example, where the nominated notice recipient is the bankrupt\u2019s employer and the notice requires ongoing periodic payments, the first instalment should not be due fewer than 14 days following the date of service of the notice or before the date of the next pay day in the pay cycle, to ensure that the employer is given time to implement any necessary payroll adjustments, and ongoing payments should be set to match the regularity with which the bankrupt is paid.e. The bankrupt\u2019s addressAs the Official Receiver is required by subsection 139ZL(6) of the Bankruptcy Act to give a copy of the section 139ZL notice to the bankrupt, the trustee must provide the bankrupt\u2019s address in the notice application.Other considerationsAlthough not specifically required by the Bankruptcy Act, it is preferred that, before an application for issue of a notice is made by a trustee, consideration is given as to whether the bankrupt is in arrears with his or her contribution payments, with reference to the most recent payment arrangement sent. In this regard, it would assist the Official Receiver if the trustee could provide evidence regarding the payment terms sent to the bankrupt when the most recent income contribution assessment was raised and attempts by the trustee to remedy the arrears.It is also suggested that the trustee consider whether the amount to be claimed pursuant to the notice could cause hardship. Where the trustee is claiming instalments from the bankrupt\u2019s salary and wages, the bankrupt should be left with a sufficient amount to enable him or her to satisfy ordinary living expenses. It will assist the Official Receiver in this regard if the trustee provides details of the bankrupt\u2019s net income and the frequency of payment of salary or wages so that the Official Receiver can calculate the percentage of income required to be held under the section 139ZL notice.The Official Receiver will consider each application on its own merit and, for some estates, may require additional facts and circumstances to be included in the notice. For example, facts and circumstances described in a notice issued to the employer of a salaried bankrupt would be different to a notice issued to a trust or a company where the bankrupt has a complex employment arrangement. In the later scenario, the schedule to the notice may be amended to include information such as the following:how the contribution liability was calculated (or liabilities for more than one CAP), such as what type of income was included, the source of the income, the identities of parties who did or should have made payments to the bankrupt etc.the employment relationship, if any is alleged, between the recipient of the notice and the bankruptdetails of any other employment relationships that the bankrupt has had with other parties who did or should have paid income to the bankruptif the contribution liability was calculated as a result of the deeming of the bankrupt\u2019s income under section 139Y or section 139Z of the Bankruptcy Act, specific details of the information and evidence relied upon to calculate the bankrupt\u2019s incomeany other particulars relevant to the issuing of the notice as considered necessary by the Official Receiver.Trustees need not include the additional information outlined in the preceding paragraph in their initial application. If the Official Receiver requires more detail due to a complex employment arrangement, supporting documents or other information will be requested from the trustee prior to completing the assessment of the trustee\u2019s application.Service of the noticeThe Official Receiver will attempt initial service on the nominated notice recipient. The Official Receiver will also provide copies of the notice to the trustee and the bankrupt.Creation of a charge over propertySection 139ZN of the Bankruptcy Act provides that, once a person is served with a notice pursuant to section 139ZL, the property is charged with the liability of the person to make payments as required in the notice. The creation of the charge is automatic by the operation of section 139ZN.The charge created generally has priority over any other mortgage or charge unless the mortgagee or chargee can demonstrate that the encumbrance was entered into at arm\u2019s length and for valuable consideration.The Official Receiver may provide a certificate to the trustee evidencing the charge for the purposes of registering the interest over real property (subsection 139ZN(4) of the Bankruptcy Act). The Official Receiver will generally not issue a certificate evidencing the charge unless the time for compliance with the notice has elapsed.The charge does not have to be registered on the Personal Properties Securities Register under thePersonal Properties Securities Act 2009.The trustee can take action to realise property over which a section 139ZN charge exists.Non-compliance with a section 139ZL noticeWhere the notice recipient fails to make payment(s) in accordance with the section 139ZL notice, the Official Receiver will refer the non-compliance to the Inspector- General in Bankruptcy (via AFSA\u2019s Enforcement and Practitioner Supervision division) for further investigation and consideration regarding prosecution action. The trustee is not required to also refer non-compliance. The trustee will be advised of the referral to the Inspector-General and the outcome.Revoking and amending noticesThe Official Receiver may, at any time, revoke or amend a section 139ZL notice.Revocation or amendment of the notice may occur:at the request of the trusteewhere the Official Receiver is satisfied that the notice should not have been issued, orwhere the Official Receiver is satisfied that the bankrupt has complied with their obligations.The Official Receiver will consider any information supplied by both the bankrupt and the trustee in making this decision.Advice of revoked or amended noticesWhen a notice is withdrawn, the Official Receiver will advise the notice recipient, trustee and bankrupt.Where a notice is amended, the Official Receiver will serve a copy on the notice recipient. Copies will also be provided to the trustee and the bankrupt.Contribution reassessmentsWhere the trustee amends a contributions assessment and a section 139ZL notice is in place, the trustee must advise the Official Receiver that the amended assessment has been issued. The request for issue of an amended section 139ZL notice will attract the $480 notice fee.Applications to set aside section 139ZL noticesIf a dispute over the merits of a notice is unable to be resolved, section 139ZM of the Bankruptcy Act provides for the recipient of the notice or any other interested party, which includes the bankrupt, applying to the court to have the notice set aside.A section 139ZM application must be made within 60 days of the notice being given to the recipient.Whether it is the Official Receiver or the trustee of the bankrupt estate who is principally responsible for responding to an application will depend on the nature of the notice, the application and the circumstances on which it has been challenged.\n\n",
            "Section 139ZL of the Bankruptcy Act\n\nSection 139ZL allows the Official Receiver to issue a notice for the recovery of income contributions payable by a bankrupt. A notice can also be issued in relation to a discharged bankrupt whose income contribution liability remains unpaid.\n\nThe Official Receiver will only consider issue of a section 139ZL notice where the bankrupt has been notified of his or her liability. It is also preferred that the bankrupt has then been given an opportunity to comply with a payment due date or payment schedule set by the trustee before an application is made for the issue of a notice.\n\nWhat the trustee must establish\n\nIn addition to the items listed in paragraph2.2above, when making an application for issue of a section 139ZL notice the trustee will need to address and satisfy the following, which are outlined in more detail below.The bankrupt has an income contribution liability and has been notified of the liability and the payment due date or schedule.The total amount payable under the notice does not exceed the total liability.The nominated notice recipient is covered by section 139ZL of the Bankruptcy Act.What is required of the nominated notice recipient and the time for compliance are reasonable.The bankrupt\u2019s address.\n\nThe bankrupt has an income contribution liability and has been notified of the liability and the payment due date or schedule.\n\nThe total amount payable under the notice does not exceed the total liability.\n\nThe nominated notice recipient is covered by section 139ZL of the Bankruptcy Act.\n\nWhat is required of the nominated notice recipient and the time for compliance are reasonable.\n\nThe bankrupt\u2019s address.\n\na. The bankrupt has a liability, has been notified of the liability and has been notified of the payment due date or payment schedule\n\nThe trustee is to provide details of the bankrupt\u2019s total contribution liability, the amount (if any) paid to date and the payment due date or payment schedule.\n\nDetails of when the bankrupt was advised of the liability and the payment schedule or payment due date must be provided.\n\nb. Total amount payable under the notice\n\nThe amount claimed in the notice cannot exceed the total amount payable by the bankrupt for the contribution assessment period(s) assessed to date.\n\nThe amount to be paid under the notice can include the total outstanding liability and not just the amount of the arrears (subsection 139ZL(3)).\n\nExample 15Where a bankrupt with a $10,000 liability for contribution assessment period 1 has paid $2000 to date and is $3000 in arrears with reference to the most recent payment schedule set by the trustee, and where the other necessary criteria for issuance of the notice have been satisfied, the notice can require the recipient to pay the remaining $8000 to the trustee (and not just the $3000 arrears amount).\n\nExample 15\n\nWhere a bankrupt with a $10,000 liability for contribution assessment period 1 has paid $2000 to date and is $3000 in arrears with reference to the most recent payment schedule set by the trustee, and where the other necessary criteria for issuance of the notice have been satisfied, the notice can require the recipient to pay the remaining $8000 to the trustee (and not just the $3000 arrears amount).\n\nPursuant to section 40 of theBankruptcy Regulations 2021, the trustee must confirm that the amount claimed in the notice is not protected money or property.\n\nc. Person to whom notice may be given\n\nThe trustee must establish that the nominated notice recipient is a person to whom section 139ZL of the Bankruptcy Act applies.\u00a0 The notice must be able to be issued against a nominated, identifiable person by name or by title and must be issued to a third party (that is, someone other than the bankrupt).\n\nNotice recipients covered by section 139ZL include a person:from whom any money is due or accruing, or may become due, to a bankruptwho holds, or may subsequently hold, money for or on account of a bankruptwho holds, or may subsequently hold, money on account of some other person for payment to or on behalf of a bankruptwho has authority from some other person to pay money to or on behalf of a bankruptwho is liable to pay money or transfer property wholly or principally in consideration of personal services supplied by a bankrupt after the commencement of the bankruptcy, whether the services were supplied to the first-mentioned person or to some other personwho has received money or property wholly or principally in consideration of personal services supplied by a bankrupt after the commencement of the bankruptcy, whether the services were supplied to the first-mentioned person or to some other person.\n\n",
            "from whom any money is due or accruing, or may become due, to a bankrupt\n\nwho holds, or may subsequently hold, money for or on account of a bankrupt\n\nwho holds, or may subsequently hold, money on account of some other person for payment to or on behalf of a bankrupt\n\nwho has authority from some other person to pay money to or on behalf of a bankrupt\n\nwho is liable to pay money or transfer property wholly or principally in consideration of personal services supplied by a bankrupt after the commencement of the bankruptcy, whether the services were supplied to the first-mentioned person or to some other person\n\nwho has received money or property wholly or principally in consideration of personal services supplied by a bankrupt after the commencement of the bankruptcy, whether the services were supplied to the first-mentioned person or to some other person.\n\nCommon examples of such a person are the bankrupt\u2019s employer or a bank at which the bankrupt holds money.\u00a0 Notices may also be issued to the Australian Taxation Office in relation to tax refunds that would otherwise be due to the bankrupt or former bankrupt.\n\nd. What is required of the nominated notice recipient and the time for compliance are reasonable\n\nThe trustee\u2019s application must state precisely what the notice recipient must do to comply with the notice. This includes details of the total amount payable to the trustee, the method of payment and the date(s) of payment(s) to be made.\n\nThe notice must provide the nominated recipient with a reasonable time period in which to comply. For example, where the nominated notice recipient is the bankrupt\u2019s employer and the notice requires ongoing periodic payments, the first instalment should not be due fewer than 14 days following the date of service of the notice or before the date of the next pay day in the pay cycle, to ensure that the employer is given time to implement any necessary payroll adjustments, and ongoing payments should be set to match the regularity with which the bankrupt is paid.\n\ne. The bankrupt\u2019s address\n\nAs the Official Receiver is required by subsection 139ZL(6) of the Bankruptcy Act to give a copy of the section 139ZL notice to the bankrupt, the trustee must provide the bankrupt\u2019s address in the notice application.\n\nOther considerations\n\nAlthough not specifically required by the Bankruptcy Act, it is preferred that, before an application for issue of a notice is made by a trustee, consideration is given as to whether the bankrupt is in arrears with his or her contribution payments, with reference to the most recent payment arrangement sent. In this regard, it would assist the Official Receiver if the trustee could provide evidence regarding the payment terms sent to the bankrupt when the most recent income contribution assessment was raised and attempts by the trustee to remedy the arrears.\n\nIt is also suggested that the trustee consider whether the amount to be claimed pursuant to the notice could cause hardship. Where the trustee is claiming instalments from the bankrupt\u2019s salary and wages, the bankrupt should be left with a sufficient amount to enable him or her to satisfy ordinary living expenses. It will assist the Official Receiver in this regard if the trustee provides details of the bankrupt\u2019s net income and the frequency of payment of salary or wages so that the Official Receiver can calculate the percentage of income required to be held under the section 139ZL notice.\n\nThe Official Receiver will consider each application on its own merit and, for some estates, may require additional facts and circumstances to be included in the notice. For example, facts and circumstances described in a notice issued to the employer of a salaried bankrupt would be different to a notice issued to a trust or a company where the bankrupt has a complex employment arrangement. In the later scenario, the schedule to the notice may be amended to include information such as the following:how the contribution liability was calculated (or liabilities for more than one CAP), such as what type of income was included, the source of the income, the identities of parties who did or should have made payments to the bankrupt etc.the employment relationship, if any is alleged, between the recipient of the notice and the bankruptdetails of any other employment relationships that the bankrupt has had with other parties who did or should have paid income to the bankruptif the contribution liability was calculated as a result of the deeming of the bankrupt\u2019s income under section 139Y or section 139Z of the Bankruptcy Act, specific details of the information and evidence relied upon to calculate the bankrupt\u2019s incomeany other particulars relevant to the issuing of the notice as considered necessary by the Official Receiver.\n\n",

If the Official Receiver requires more detail due to a complex employment arrangement, supporting documents or other information will be requested from the trustee prior to completing the assessment of the trustee\u2019s application.\n\nService of the notice\n\nThe Official Receiver will attempt initial service on the nominated notice recipient.

The Official Receiver will generally not issue a certificate evidencing the charge unless the time for compliance with the notice has elapsed.\n\nThe charge does not have to be registered on the Personal Properties Securities Register under thePersonal Properties Securities Act 2009.\n\nThe trustee can take action to realise property over which a section 139ZN charge exists.\n\nNon-compliance with a section 139ZL notice\n\nWhere the notice recipient fails to make payment(s) in accordance with the section 139ZL notice, the Official Receiver will refer the non-compliance to the Inspector- General in Bankruptcy (via AFSA\u2019s Enforcement and Practitioner Supervision division) for further investigation and consideration regarding prosecution action. The trustee is not required to also refer non-compliance. The trustee will be advised of the referral to the Inspector-General and the outcome.\n\nRevoking and amending notices\n\nThe Official Receiver may, at any time, revoke or amend a section 139ZL notice.Revocation or amendment of the notice may occur:at the request of the trusteewhere the Official Receiver is satisfied that the notice should not have been issued, orwhere the Official Receiver is satisfied that the bankrupt has complied with their obligations.The Official Receiver will consider any information supplied by both the bankrupt and the trustee in making this decision.\n\nat the request of the trustee\n\nwhere the Official Receiver is satisfied that the notice should not have been issued, or\n\nwhere the Official Receiver is satisfied that the bankrupt has complied with their obligations.\n\nThe Official Receiver will consider any information supplied by both the bankrupt and the trustee in making this decision.\n\nAdvice of revoked or amended notices\n\nWhen a notice is withdrawn, the Official Receiver will advise the notice recipient, trustee and bankrupt.\n\n",
            "Where a notice is amended, the Official Receiver will serve a copy on the notice recipient. Copies will also be provided to the trustee and the bankrupt.\n\nContribution reassessments\n\nWhere the trustee amends a contributions assessment and a section 139ZL notice is in place, the trustee must advise the Official Receiver that the amended assessment has been issued. The request for issue of an amended section 139ZL notice will attract the $480 notice fee.\n\nApplications to set aside section 139ZL notices\n\nIf a dispute over the merits of a notice is unable to be resolved, section 139ZM of the Bankruptcy Act provides for the recipient of the notice or any other interested party, which includes the bankrupt, applying to the court to have the notice set aside.\n\nA section 139ZM application must be made within 60 days of the notice being given to the recipient.\n\nWhether it is the Official Receiver or the trustee of the bankrupt estate who is principally responsible for responding to an application will depend on the nature of the notice, the application and the circumstances on which it has been challenged.\n\nSection 139ZQ \u2013 requirement to pay money where a transaction is void against the trusteeSection 139ZQ of the Bankruptcy ActSection 139ZQ allows the Official Receiver to issue a notice to a person who has received money or property as a result of a transaction that is void against the trustee, with the notice requiring that person to pay to the trustee an amount equal to the money or the value of the property received. Generally, this type of notice applies to transactions that are void against the trustee under the following provisions of the Bankruptcy Act:section 120 \u2013 undervalued transferssection 121 \u2013 transfers made with the intention to defeat creditorssection 121A \u2013 a transfer for less than market value or a transfer made with the intention to defeat creditors where consideration was given to a third partysection 122 \u2013 voidable preferencessection 128B \u2013 superannuation contributions made to defeat creditors where the contributor is a person who later becomes a bankruptsection 128C \u2013 superannuation contributions made to defeat creditors where the contributor is a third party.The Official Receiver does not exercise a judicial function and so is not required or authorised to adjudicate on whether the transfer is actually void.\u00a0Instead, the Official Receiver must be satisfied that the trustee has provided prima facie evidence of a void transfer, based on the facts and circumstances of the transfer, sufficient to allow exercise of the discretion to issue a notice.[5]Any determination of whether a transfer is actually void must be made by a court.Exercising power in good faith and for a proper purposeCase law dictates that the Official Receiver\u2019s power be exercised in good faith and for a proper purpose.\u00a0The court found inTsakirakis[6]that the issuance of a section 139ZQ notice, where the result would be that the trustee received information to assist him in a case that was before the court, was an inappropriate use of the Official Receiver\u2019s powers.What the trustee must establish \u2013 section 120 undervalued transactionSection 120 of the Bankruptcy Act provides for a transfer of property (with the definition of \u201cproperty\u201d including money) by a person who later becomes bankrupt being void against the trustee if:the transfer took place in the period beginning 5 years before the commencement of the bankruptcy and ending on the date of bankruptcythe transferee gave consideration of less than the market value of the propertythe transfer is not caught by an exemption stated in section 120.In addition to the items listed in paragraph2.2above, where the trustee applies for a section 139ZQ notice on the basis of a transfer being void under section 120, the Official Receiver will require the following:the date of the commencement of the bankruptcy (including evidence of the act of bankruptcy on which that date has been determined) under section 115 of the Bankruptcy Actevidence that a transfer took place on a particular datea detailed description of the transfer that gave the benefit to the nominated notice recipientif the transfer occurred more than 2 years prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy (or more than 4 years where the transfer was to a related entity), evidence that the bankrupt was insolvent at the time of the transferevidence of any consideration provided and how this was taken into account in determining the amount the trustee is seeking to recover via the notice, including an acceptable valuation of the property at the time of the transferevidence of any consideration provided by the transferee and how this has been taken into accountan explanation and evidence supporting the assertion that the transfer is void against the trusteea summary of any legal action(s) on foot that relate to the same estate or to the same issue/property within the estatethe value of the property received at the time the application for issuance of the notice is madethe address of the bankrupt.What the trustee must establish \u2013 section 121 transfer to defeat creditorsSection 121 of the Bankruptcy Act provides for a transfer of property (with the definition of \u201cproperty\u201d including money) by a person who later becomes bankrupt being void against the bankruptcy trustee where:the property would probably have become part of the transferor\u2019s bankrupt estate if it had not been transferredthe transferor\u2019s main purpose in making the transfer was to prevent, hinder or delay the transferred property becoming divisible among the transferor\u2019s creditorsthe transfer is not caught by an exemption stated in section 121.In addition to the items listed in paragraph2.2above, where the trustee applies for a section 139ZQ notice on the basis of a transfer being void under section 121, the Official Receiver will require the following:evidence that a transfer took place on a particular datea detailed description of the transfer that gave the benefit to the nominated notice recipientif the trustee is relying on an assumption that the bankrupt was insolvent at the time of the transfer, evidence of insolvency at that timewhere the trustee is claiming that the transfer was made to defeat creditors but is not relying on the bankrupt being insolvent at the time, detailed reasons and evidence in support of this claimevidence of any consideration provided and how this was taken into account in determining the amount the trustee is seeking to recover via the notice, including an acceptable valuation of the property at the time of the transferdetails of any statements given by the transferee in relation to the transfer (in particular, any statements relating to the matters listed in subsection 121(4))the trustee\u2019s reasons for claiming that the transfer was made with the intention to defeat creditors and that the transfer is void against the trusteea summary of any legal action(s) on foot that relate to the same estate or to the same issue/property within the estatethe value of the property received at the time the application for issuance of the notice is madethe address of the bankrupt.The Official Receiver is unlikely to issue a notice in relation to a transfer claimed to be void under section 121 where the trustee is unable to provide evidence that the bankrupt was insolvent at the time of the transfer but claims that the transfer was made with the intention to defeat creditors. This would require the Official Receiver to adjudicate on the merits of the trustee\u2019s arguments under section 121. The Official Receiver may consider issuing the notice where the trustee produces evidence consisting of clear statements by the bankrupt in relation to his or her intention in making the transfer.What the trustee must establish \u2013 section 121A undervalued transfer or transfer to defeat creditorsSection 121A provides for an undervalued transfer (section 120) and a transfer to defeat creditors (section 121) being void where consideration was given to a third party.Where a trustee lodges an application for issue of a section 121A notice, the application must:address the items listed in paragraph2.2abovein the case of an undervalued transaction, the items listed in paragraph9.5above, together with evidence of the consideration given to the third partyin the case of a transfer to defeat creditors, the items listed in paragraph9.7above, together with evidence of the consideration given to the third party.What the trustee must establish \u2013 section 122 preference paymentSection 122 provides for a transfer of property, by a person who is insolvent and who later becomes bankrupt, in favour of a creditor being void against the trustee if the transfer:had the effect of giving the creditor a preference, priority or advantage over other creditorswas made in the period beginning 6 months before the presentation of the petition on which the debtor becomes bankrupt and ending immediately before the date of bankruptcythe transfer is not caught by an exemption stated in section 122.In addition to the items listed in paragraph2.2above, where the trustee applies for a section 139ZQ notice on the basis of a transfer being void under section 122 of the Bankruptcy Act, the Official Receiver will require the following:evidence of a payment to a creditor within the required period prior to the bankruptcyan explanation and evidence supporting the assertion that the payment had the effect of giving that creditor a preference, priority or advantage over other creditors and that the transfer is voidan explanation and evidence establishing that the bankrupt was insolvent at the time of the transfera summary of any legal action(s) on foot that relate to the same estate or to the same issue/creditor within the estatethe address of the bankrupt.What the trustee must establish \u2013 section 128B and 128C superannuation contributionsSection 128B of the Bankruptcy Act provides for a transfer of property (with the definition of \u201cproperty\u201d including money) by a person who later becomes bankrupt to an eligible superannuation plan being void against the bankruptcy trustee where:the property would probably have become part of the transferor\u2019s estate or been available to creditors if it had not been transferredthe transferor\u2019s main purpose was to prevent, hinder or delay the transferred property from becoming divisible among the bankrupt\u2019s creditorsthe transfer occurred on or after 28 July 2006.In addition to the items listed in paragraph2.2above, where the trustee applies for a section 139ZQ notice on the basis of a transfer being void under section 128B of the Bankruptcy Act, the Official Receiver will require the following:evidence that the person made a contribution to an eligible superannuation plan on a particular date that was on or after 28 July 2006a detailed description of the transferevidence supporting the trustee\u2019s claim that the transfer was made with the intention to defeat creditors and that the transfer is voidwhere the trustee is relying on an assumption that the bankrupt was insolvent at the time of making the transfer, evidence of insolvency at that timewhere the trustee is relying on the bankrupt\u2019s history of making superannuation contributions and that the transfer is \u201cout of character\u201d in order to assert that it was made with the intention to defeat creditors, evidence of the bankrupt\u2019s history of making superannuation contributions as well as detailed reasons and evidence to demonstrate the bankrupt\u2019s intentionwhere the trustee is claiming that the transfer was made to defeat creditors but is not relying on either the bankrupt being insolvent at the time or the bankrupt\u2019s history of making superannuation contributions, detailed reasons and evidence in support of this claima summary of any legal action(s) on foot that relate to the same estate or to the same issue/property within the estatethe address of the bankrupt.Section 128C of the Bankruptcy Act operates similarly to section 128B, but covers the situation where the transfer to the eligible superannuation plan was made by a person other than the bankrupt and was made on behalf of the bankrupt.In addition to the items listed in paragraph2.2above, where the trustee applies for a section 139ZQ notice on the basis of a transfer being void under section 128C of the Bankruptcy Act, the Official Receiver will require the following:evidence that a transfer was made to an eligible superannuation plan on a particular date (which must be on or after 28 July 2006) for the benefit of the bankrupta detailed description of the transfera detailed description of the arrangements (to which the bankrupt must have been a party) under which the person made the transfer for the bankrupt\u2019s benefitevidence supporting the trustee\u2019s claim that the transfer was made with the intention to defeat creditors and that the transfer is voidwhere the trustee is relying on an assumption that the bankrupt was insolvent at the time the bankrupt entered into the arrangement to defeat creditors, evidence of insolvency at that timewhere the trustee is relying on the bankrupt\u2019s history of making superannuation contributions and that the transfer is \u201cout of character\u201d in order to assert that it was made pursuant to a scheme entered into by the bankrupt with the intention to defeat creditors, evidence of the bankrupt\u2019s history of making superannuation contributions as well as detailed reasons and evidence to demonstrate the bankrupt\u2019s intentionwhere the trustee is claiming that the transfer was made to defeat creditors but is not relying on either the bankrupt being insolvent at the time or the bankrupt\u2019s history of making superannuation contributions, detailed reasons and evidence in support of this claima summary of any legal actions on foot that relate to the same estate or to the same issue/property within the estatethe address of the bankrupt.The Official Receiver is unlikely to issue a notice in relation to a superannuation contribution claimed to be void under section 128B or section 128C where the trustee is unable to provide evidence that the bankrupt was insolvent at the time the contribution was made but claims that the transfer was made with the intention to defeat creditors. This would require the Official Receiver to adjudicate on the merits of the trustee\u2019s arguments under section 128B or section 128C. However, the Official Receiver may consider issuing the notice where the trustee produces evidence consisting of clear statements by the bankrupt in relation to his or her intention in making the contribution or entering into an arrangement whereby the contributions were made by a third party. The Official Receiver may also consider issuing the notice where the trustee provides evidence that the contribution was \u201cout of character\u201d in light of the bankrupt\u2019s history of making superannuation contributions and the bankrupt is unable to provide a sound explanation of the purpose in making the contribution.Where there was a transaction that was void against the trustee under section 128B or section 128C of the Bankruptcy Act, and where the property that was transferred to a superannuation fund is later rolled over to a second superannuation fund, and where the bankruptcy trustee seeks to recover the rolled over amounts from the superannuation fund trustee, the bankruptcy trustee must provide sufficient evidence:tracing the property to the second superannuation fundthat the amount claimed does not exceed the amount that would be available under section 139ZU of the Bankruptcy Act.Service of the noticeThe Official Receiver will attempt service of a notice on the nominated recipient in the first instance, using the address information provided by the trustee.Copies of the notice will be provided to the trustee and the bankrupt.Creation of a charge over propertySection 139ZR of the Bankruptcy Act provides that, once a person is served with a notice pursuant to section 139ZQ, the property is charged with the liability of the person to make payments as required in the notice. The creation of the charge is automatic by the operation of the section. The charge is discharged when payment is made.The charge will only arise where a notice is validly given under section 139ZQ in respect of property other than money.The charge created generally has priority over any other mortgage or charge in favour of an associated entity of the bankrupt, unless the mortgagee or chargee can demonstrate that the encumbrance was entered into at arm\u2019s length, for valuable consideration and is not void as against the trustee.The Official Receiver may provide a certificate to the trustee evidencing the charge for the purposes of registering the interest over real property (subsection 139ZR(4)). The Official Receiver will generally not issue a certificate evidencing the charge unless the time for compliance with the notice has elapsed.Non-compliance with a section 139ZQ noticeFailure to comply with a section 139ZQ notice is an offence punishable, upon conviction, by imprisonment for up to 6 months (pursuant to subsection 139ZT(1)). The court can also impose on a notice recipient who failed to comply a penalty and can order the person to pay to the trustee the amount that was required to be paid under the notice (subsection 139ZT(2)).Where the notice recipient fails to comply with the notice, the Official Receiver will refer the non-compliance to the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy (via AFSA\u2019s Enforcement and Practitioner Supervision division) for further investigation and consideration regarding prosecution action. The trustee is not required to also refer non-compliance. The trustee will be advised of the referral to the Inspector- General and the outcome.Withdrawing and amending noticesThe Official Receiver may, at any time, withdraw, revoke or amend the notice.\u00a0 The Official Receiver may do so if:satisfied that the notice should not have been issuedsatisfied that the bankrupt has complied with his or her obligations.The Official Receiver will not withdraw the notice unless satisfied that the evidence upon which it was based did not exist.\u00a0 The Official Receiver will not adjudicate on arguments about whether the transfer of property underlying the notice was actually void.\u00a0 The Official Receiver\u2019s only concern is to decide whether the trustee provided sufficient evidence upon which the discretion to issue the notice could be based.\u00a0 If there is a dispute about whether a transfer of property is void, the Official Receiver will let the notice stand and the trustee can take action to enforce the notice and the Court will decide on the merits of the arguments about the status of the transfer.Applications to set aside section 139ZQ noticesIf a dispute over the merits of a notice is unable to be resolved, section 139ZS of the Bankruptcy Act provides for the recipient of the notice or any other interested party, which includes the bankrupt, applying to the court to have the notice set aside.Where the party challenging the notice is the notice recipient, a section 139ZS application must be made within 60 days of the notice being given.\u00a0Where the party challenging the notice is not the notice recipient, the application must be made within 60 days of the party becoming aware of the giving of the notice.Given that the basis of a notice issued pursuant to section 139ZQ is the existence of a transaction that is void as against the trustee, where an application is made to set aside a notice the trustee will have principal responsibility for demonstrating the facts advanced in support of the notice.[7]The courts have held that it is not appropriate for the recipient of a section 139ZQ notice to seek judicial review under both the AD(JR) Act and a statutory appeal under section 139ZS of the Bankruptcy Act (seeKiem Dang Investment Pty Ltd v Mansfield & Official Receiver[2017] FCCA 725).\n\n",
            "Section 139ZQ of the Bankruptcy Act\n\nSection 139ZQ allows the Official Receiver to issue a notice to a person who has received money or property as a result of a transaction that is void against the trustee, with the notice requiring that person to pay to the trustee an amount equal to the money or the value of the property received. Generally, this type of notice applies to transactions that are void against the trustee under the following provisions of the Bankruptcy Act:section 120 \u2013 undervalued transferssection 121 \u2013 transfers made with the intention to defeat creditorssection 121A \u2013 a transfer for less than market value or a transfer made with the intention to defeat creditors where consideration was given to a third partysection 122 \u2013 voidable preferencessection 128B \u2013 superannuation contributions made to defeat creditors where the contributor is a person who later becomes a bankruptsection 128C \u2013 superannuation contributions made to defeat creditors where the contributor is a third party.\n\nsection 120 \u2013 undervalued transfers\n\nsection 121 \u2013 transfers made with the intention to defeat creditors\n\nsection 121A \u2013 a transfer for less than market value or a transfer made with the intention to defeat creditors where consideration was given to a third party\n\nsection 122 \u2013 voidable preferences\n\nsection 128B \u2013 superannuation contributions made to defeat creditors where the contributor is a person who later becomes a bankrupt\n\nsection 128C \u2013 superannuation contributions made to defeat creditors where the contributor is a third party.\n\nThe Official Receiver does not exercise a judicial function and so is not required or authorised to adjudicate on whether the transfer is actually void.\u00a0Instead, the Official Receiver must be satisfied that the trustee has provided prima facie evidence of a void transfer, based on the facts and circumstances of the transfer, sufficient to allow exercise of the discretion to issue a notice.[5]Any determination of whether a transfer is actually void must be made by a court.\n\nExercising power in good faith and for a proper purpose\n\nCase law dictates that the Official Receiver\u2019s power be exercised in good faith and for a proper purpose.\u00a0The court found inTsakirakis[6]that the issuance of a section 139ZQ notice, where the result would be that the trustee received information to assist him in a case that was before the court, was an inappropriate use of the Official Receiver\u2019s powers.\n\nWhat the trustee must establish \u2013 section 120 undervalued transaction\n\nSection 120 of the Bankruptcy Act provides for a transfer of property (with the definition of \u201cproperty\u201d including money) by a person who later becomes bankrupt being void against the trustee if:the transfer took place in the period beginning 5 years before the commencement of the bankruptcy and ending on the date of bankruptcythe transferee gave consideration of less than the market value of the propertythe transfer is not caught by an exemption stated in section 120.\n\nthe transfer took place in the period beginning 5 years before the commencement of the bankruptcy and ending on the date of bankruptcy\n\nthe transferee gave consideration of less than the market value of the property\n\nthe transfer is not caught by an exemption stated in section 120.\n\nIn addition to the items listed in paragraph2.2above, where the trustee applies for a section 139ZQ notice on the basis of a transfer being void under section 120, the Official Receiver will require the following:the date of the commencement of the bankruptcy (including evidence of the act of bankruptcy on which that date has been determined) under section 115 of the Bankruptcy Actevidence that a transfer took place on a particular datea detailed description of the transfer that gave the benefit to the nominated notice recipientif the transfer occurred more than 2 years prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy (or more than 4 years where the transfer was to a related entity), evidence that the bankrupt was insolvent at the time of the transferevidence of any consideration provided and how this was taken into account in determining the amount the trustee is seeking to recover via the notice, including an acceptable valuation of the property at the time of the transferevidence of any consideration provided by the transferee and how this has been taken into accountan explanation and evidence supporting the assertion that the transfer is void against the trusteea summary of any legal action(s) on foot that relate to the same estate or to the same issue/property within the estatethe value of the property received at the time the application for issuance of the notice is madethe address of the bankrupt.\n\n",

is not provided.The committee will also need to consider if there are any issues that prevent the applicant being registered as set out in subsection 20-20 of the Schedule namely, that the applicant:has been convicted, within 10 years before making the application, of an offence involving fraud or dishonestyis or has been, within 10 years before making the application, insolvent under administrationhas had their registration as a trustee under the Bankruptcy Act cancelled within 10 years before making the application, other than in response to a written request by the applicant to have the registration cancelledhas had their registration as a liquidator under theCorporations Act 2001cancelled within 10 years before making the application, other than in response to a written request by the applicant to have the registration cancelledis disqualified from managing corporations under Part 2D.6 of theCorporations Act 2001, or under a law of an external Territory or a law of a foreign countryis not otherwise a fit and proper person[2]is not resident in Australia or in another prescribed country.Note that the committee may decide that the applicant should be registered even if the committee is not satisfied of a matter mentioned in paragraph (c), (d), or (g), provided the committee is satisfied that the applicant would be suitable to be registered as a trustee if they complied with conditions specified by the committee.Insurance requirementsThe committee must be satisfied that the applicant will take out:adequate and appropriate professional indemnity insuranceadequate and appropriate fidelity insuranceagainst the liabilities that the applicant may incur working as a registered trustee.The level of professional indemnity insurance to be taken out is expected to comply with the professional standards scheme of the national occupational association to which the trustee (or the trustee\u2019s firm) belongs. \u00a0If the trustee (or the trustee\u2019s firm) does not belong to a national occupational association then a level of insurance equivalent with either of the schemes of Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand or CPA Australia is considered adequate. \u00a0There is no particular expectation about the level of fidelity insurance except that it be adequate and appropriate for the trustee\u2019s circumstances.In practice, this information is obtained before the committee is formed. \u00a0Applicants will be asked to provide a National Police Certificate and overseas police check if relevant. \u00a0The Inspector-General will undertake checks of the National Personal Insolvency Index and the relevant Australian Securities & Investments Commission database.The applicant will be informed should one of these grounds be established. \u00a0If the application is subsequently withdrawn before being referred to a committee the application fee will be refunded.Once the committee convenes (seebelow), the fee is non-refundable.It should be noted that if a committee, once formed, considers that the applicant is suitable to be registered as a trustee it may, pursuant to subsection 20-20(5) of the Schedule, decide that the applicant should be registered even if it is not satisfied that the applicant has the qualifications, experience, knowledge and abilities prescribed.Accordingly, where there

insolvency proceedings in Australia.\u00a0 Its creation and maintenance are provided for in Part 13 of theBankruptcy Regulations 2021.The Inspector-General in Bankruptcy has had the statutory responsibility for the operation of the index since December 1996.\u00a0 Prior to December 1996, the records were kept by the Federal Registrar in Bankruptcy (an office of the Federal Court).The Official Receiver[1]has a statutory responsibility to maintain the NPII on behalf of the Inspector-General.Scope of this practice documentThis practice document outlines the information recorded on the NPII, suppression of personal information on request and access to the NPII.This practice document has been prepared to provide detailed information about the maintenance of the NPII, including citing relevant legislative provisions.\u00a0 For a more general overview of the NPII, you may wish to read the information onAFSA\u2019s website.\n\nWhat is the National Personal Insolvency

and access to the NPII.\n\nThis practice document has been prepared to provide detailed information about the maintenance of the NPII, including citing relevant legislative provisions.\u00a0 For a more general overview of the NPII, you may wish to read the information onAFSA\u2019s website.\n\nWhat is recorded on the NPII?Information entered on the NPII is sourced from documents that are lodged or filed with the Official Receiver or Inspector-General.Information recorded on the NPII includes:the name and other personal information that identifies a debtor or bankruptthe type of administration or proceedingthe trustee, administrator or controlling trustee of the administration or proceedingthe petitioning creditor and/or petitioning creditor\u2019s solicitor (where a creditor\u2019s petition is registered)the date an administration or proceeding startedthe current status of the administration or proceeding, for example whether a person has been discharged from a bankruptcy.Some documents or information given to the Official Receiver may require assessment or verification before the relevant information can be entered on the NPII.Information is generally entered on the NPII on the same day that the originating document is accepted as complete by the Official Receiver or the information has been verified.Type of administration or proceedingEntry of information on the NPII will always be connected with an administration or proceeding under theBankruptcy Act 1966.The following are the types of matters recorded on the NPII:creditors\u2019 petitionsbankruptcies (debtors\u2019 petitions and sequestration orders)debt agreement proposals, where the proposals are accepted for processingdebt agreementssection 188 authorities (personal insolvency agreement proposals)personal insolvency agreementsPart XI administration orders (bankrupt deceased estates)section 50 orders (pre-bankruptcy property control orders).Personal information about a debtorPersonal information regarding any person who is subject to an administration or proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act is entered onto the NPII.\u00a0 That information is:name (family and given names)date of birth (if known)aliases (if any)residential address at date of lodgment of documents (if known)occupation (if known).All personal information registered on the NPII is expected to match the information written on the source document.\u00a0 For example, if a person misspells their name on the document, such as \u201cMicheal\u201d instead of \u201cMichael\u201d, that is how it will appear on the NPII.Personal information including address and occupation is not changed once it is registered on the NPII.\u00a0 Although the Bankruptcy Act requires changes of name and address that occur during the course of an administration to be advised to the trustee, change of address information does not appear on the NPII.AliasesIf the Official Receiver is advised of a change to a person\u2019s name and evidence is provided to support this, the new name is registered as an alias and appears on the NPII as such.\u00a0 For example, a change of name evidenced by a copy of a marriage certificate or certificate of change of name by deed poll will be recorded as an alias.An alias can also be registered where it is established that the person is known by or has been known by another name.\u00a0 Establishment of an alias can occur by:the debtor or bankrupt stating in writing that they are known, or have been known, by another name or names \u2013 for example, disclosure on the statement of affairs/Bankruptcy Form or written advice during bankruptcy of a change of name by marriage or deed pollevidence from a creditor or another person.\u00a0 The creditor or other person must provide a document that clearly shows that the debtor is known by another name and that the debtor and the other name are one and the same person \u2013 for example, a loan document or other application where the debtor has revealed that they are known by another namea written statement from the trustee or administrator, where investigations have determined that the debtor is or was known by another name, accompanied by evidence.Trustee or administratorEvery administration recorded on the NPII has the trustee or administrator named and the type of appointment stated.\u00a0 The trustee or administrator\u2019s contact details, business name, business address and business phone number are also displayed.Where a creditor\u2019s petition is recorded, the contact details of the solicitor or agent acting for the creditor and/or the creditor\u2019s contact details appear.A trustee or administrator can be changed during an administration.\u00a0 Where this occurs, the NPII is updated based on documents filed with the Official Receiver.AFSA maintains a record of all persons who are or have applied to be registered as trustees or debt agreement administrators.\u00a0 Details regarding the registration and regulation of trustees and debt agreement administrators can be found onAFSA\u2019s website.\n\n",

have been known, by another name or names \u2013 for example, disclosure on the statement of affairs/Bankruptcy Form or written advice during bankruptcy of a change of name by marriage or deed pollevidence from a creditor or another person.\u00a0 The creditor or other person must provide a document that clearly shows that the debtor is known by another name and that the debtor and the other name are one and the same person \u2013 for example, a loan document or other application where the debtor has revealed that they are known by another namea written statement from the trustee or administrator, where investigations have determined that the debtor is or was known by another name, accompanied by evidence.\n\n",

believes that publishing their address and/or occupation on the NPII may put their safety at risk, they may apply to have the address and/or occupation suppressed (see section 80 of the Bankruptcy Regulations). \u00a0An application to have information suppressed must be made in writing to theInspector-General.The\u00a0Inspector-General will consider all requests made in writing.Examples of documents that will assist in the assessment of an application include:a domestic violence order, apprehended violence order or similar type of ordera police report regarding threats of personal violencea report from a social worker, medical practitioner, psychiatrist or other relevant practitioner.While supporting documents will assist in the assessment of an application, the provision of such information by the applicant is not mandatory. \u00a0The delegate must be mindful that the debtor\u2019s or bankrupt\u2019s personal circumstances may make it difficult to gather together supporting evidence. \u00a0This means that decisions may be required to be made based solely on the written application.Decisions to suppress information are made by the Inspector-General or a delegate.A person\u2019s name and date of birth cannot be suppressed.Each application must be considered without delay and a decision is usually made within 1 day of receipt of the necessary information.Each application is considered on its merits and the debtor or bankrupt is notified in writing of the decision.\u00a0 Should the debtor or bankrupt be unhappy with the decision made, there is a right of appeal to the Administrative Review Tribunal.The trustee or administrator of a matter listed at paragraph 2.6 above must be notified immediately by the Inspector-General when a suppression application is approved. \u00a0The notification will set out the effect of a suppression decision on the administration of the matter.Any decision made to suppress an address and/or occupation affects only the information displayed on the NPII from the date of the decision and into the future.\u00a0 Information that was accessed on the NPII prior to the decision to suppress will not be affected.Where evidence of the kind described in paragraph 3.3 above is provided to the Inspector-General by a third party on behalf of a debtor or bankrupt, the Official Receiver will consider the evidence as if it had been provided by the debtor or bankrupt.\u00a0 That is, while section 80 of the Bankruptcy Regulations does reference a request for suppression of information being made by the debtor or bankrupt, it is recognised that evidence such as a domestic violence order or a police report will carry the same weight whether it is provided by the debtor or bankrupt or by a third party with access to that evidence.Witness protectionWhere a person who is placed on a witness protection program is or becomes subject to an administration or proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act, any name (including a change of name), alias or address that could identify that person will not be published on the NPII, on the acceptance of a request made to the Inspector-General.A request to withhold identifying information from the NPII is made by the relevant police department and is dealt with by the Official Receiver.\n\n",

inaccurate, misleading or duplicated should immediately be brought to the attention of theOfficial Receiver.\u00a0 Changes to registered NPII information can be made only with the authorisation of the Official Receiver and are made as a matter of high priority.As the NPII contains records that date back to 1928, there may be some records that are incomplete as the relevant source documents may not be available (in particular, records prior to December 1996).Removing NPII recordsEntries on the NPII can only be removed in the following circumstances:where a bankruptcy is set aside by the Courtinformation regarding debt agreements and debt agreement proposals are removed from the NPII after the prescribed lengths of time, pursuant to sections 82 and 83 of the Bankruptcy Regulationswhere an administrative oversight has occurred when processing a document (for example, where a duplicate record has been created)the Court directs removal of a particular entry from the NPII.Where a record on the NPII is removed, an administrative record of the matter is created and associated documents are retained by the Official Receiver as part of this administrative record.Debt agreement[2]records are moved from the NPII in the following circumstances:Completion of the debt agreement/discharge of all the debtor\u2019s obligations under the debt agreement (as per section 185N of the Bankruptcy Act)The NPII record will be removed in one month of the following:5 years after the date the debt agreement was made, orthe day the debt agreement was completed,whichever is

arrears default (section 185QA), oroccurred as a result of the debtor becoming bankrupt (section 185R)The NPII record will be removed in one month of the following:5 years after the date the debt agreement was made, or2 years after the day the debt agreement was terminated,whichever is laterWhere an order of the Court declared the debt agreement void (in accordance with section 185U of the

Receiver.Annulment of a bankrupt estateWhere an annulment of a bankruptcy is made for any reason, the NPII record is not removed; rather, the record is updated to reflect the fact that the bankruptcy has been annulled.Consolidation of proceedingsIn the circumstance where there are 2 separate bankrupt estates that have been consolidated by the Court under section 53 of the Bankruptcy Act, the consolidated administration will not be recorded on the NPII.\u00a0 This is because recording the consolidated estate on the NPII is not a requirement of the Bankruptcy Regulations.\n\n",

            "IntroductionA bankruptcy notice is a formal notice of demand requiring a debtor to pay a judgment debt.\u00a0 Pursuant to section 41 of theBankruptcy Act 1966, the Official Receiver may issue a bankruptcy notice on the application of a creditor who has satisfied various requirements.Failure by a debtor to comply with a bankruptcy notice constitutes an \u201cact of bankruptcy\u201d pursuant to section 40 of the Bankruptcy Act.In a situation where a debtor has committed an act of bankruptcy in the preceding 6 months, a creditor may apply (referred to as a \u201ccreditor\u2019s petition\u201d) to the Federal Court or Federal Circuit and Family Court for an order that a debtor be made bankrupt (referred to as a \u201csequestration order\u201d).\u00a0 The majority of creditors\u2019 petitions presented to the Court are based on debtors\u2019 failures to comply with bankruptcy notices.Scope of this practice documentThis practice document has been prepared to provide detailed information about the legislative and practice requirements relating to bankruptcy notices for debtors and creditors.\u00a0 If you would like more general overview, you may wish to read the information onAFSA\u2019s website.\n\nA bankruptcy notice is a formal notice of demand requiring a debtor to pay a judgment debt.\u00a0 Pursuant to section 41 of theBankruptcy Act 1966, the Official Receiver may issue a bankruptcy notice on the application of a creditor who has satisfied various requirements.\n\nFailure by a debtor to comply with a bankruptcy notice constitutes an \u201cact of bankruptcy\u201d pursuant to section 40 of the Bankruptcy Act.\n\nIn a situation where a debtor has committed an act of bankruptcy in the preceding 6 months, a creditor may apply (referred to as a \u201ccreditor\u2019s petition\u201d) to the Federal Court or Federal Circuit and Family Court for an order that a debtor be made bankrupt (referred to as a \u201csequestration order\u201d).\u00a0 The majority of creditors\u2019 petitions presented to the Court are based on debtors\u2019 failures to comply with bankruptcy notices.\n\nScope of this practice document\n\nThis practice document has been prepared to provide detailed information about the legislative and practice requirements relating to bankruptcy notices for debtors and creditors.\u00a0 If you would like more general overview, you may wish to read the information onAFSA\u2019s website.\n\nProcessing a bankruptcy notice applicationThe applicationAn application for a bankruptcy notice can be made by the creditor or the creditor\u2019s solicitor/duly authorised agent.\u00a0 Where a solicitor/agent is applying for the issue of a bankruptcy notice on behalf of a client, this should be indicated during the application process.\u00a0 The solicitor/agent needs to be satisfied that the requisite authority to apply for the bankruptcy notice to be issued has been obtained.An application for a bankruptcy notice must be submitted viaAFSA\u2019s Online Services(once registered as a user).\u00a0 A creditor who is not registered for AFSA\u2019s Online Services will need to register on AFSA\u2019s website so that applications can be submitted to the Official Receiver via the website.The appropriate application fee will have to be paid as part of the online application process.\u00a0 More information about the fee can be foundbelow.To apply online for the issue of a bankruptcy notice, the creditor will need to have one of the following:a copy of the sealed or certified judgment(s) or order(s)a certificate of the judgment(s) or order(s) sealed by the Court or signed by an officer of the Court, ora copy of the entry of the judgment(s) or order(s) certified as a true copy of that entry and sealed by the Court or signed by an officer of the Court.An application for a bankruptcy notice that does not comply with the requirements outlined above may be returned for resubmission.The application feeA creditor applying for the issue of a bankruptcy notice must pay theapplication feeat the time of lodgment unless an alternative payment arrangement has been agreed with AFSA.\u00a0 The fee may be paid by credit card or bank payment (electronic funds transfer - EFT). For more information seeCreditor bankruptcy notices payment information.The application fee attaches to theapplicationfor issue of a bankruptcy notice and not the issue of a notice.\u00a0 This means that the fee is payable when the application is made, even if the notice is not ultimately issued by the Official Receiver.A creditor who frequently applies for the issue of bankruptcy notices may wish to consider becoming an on-account customer with AFSA.\u00a0 Details about this can be found onAFSA\u2019s website.The fee for the application for issue of a bankruptcy notice is GST exempt.\u00a0 A GST invoice is therefore not issued to the applicant.The application fee cannot be waived or refunded where a creditor later discovers that there was an error or deficiency in the application and/or attachments that were submitted to the Official Receiver.The application fee is not refundable if a creditor subsequently changes their mind regarding proceeding with obtaining a bankruptcy notice after lodging an application with the Official Receiver.Judgment/order overviewA precondition to the issue of a bankruptcy notice is the existence of either:a final judgment or final order that is for an amount of at least $10,000, or2 or more final judgments or final orders that, taken together, are for an amount of at least $10,000.The $10,000 minimum is provided for in section 10A of theBankruptcy Regulations 2021.During the application process, one of the documents referred to in paragraph2.4will need to be attached or uploaded.Some jurisdictions provide for the \u201cextraction\u201d of judgments electronically rather than on paper.\u00a0 Whether a judgment that has been extracted electronically will be sufficient to support a bankruptcy notice will depend on State or Territory legislation in respect of electronic judgments.The $10,000 minimumThe amount outstanding under the judgment(s) or order(s)at the time that the bankruptcy notice is applied formust be at least $10,000.Example 1A judgment for $9900 plus $100 pre-judgment interest plus $100 costs is a judgment for $10,100 and will meet this requirement.Example 2A judgment for $9900 will not meet the requirement if, at the time of applying for issue of the bankruptcy notice, the amount owing pursuant to that judgment may be $9900 plus $200 post-judgment interest.On occasion, a judgment or order may be issued by a Court that refers to a number of other judgments/orders and directs their payment (for example, where a number of orders for costs are made during an action and a final judgment is made that refers to the previous costs orders and directs their payment).\u00a0 An application based on this judgment should have the final judgment and the other orders referred to in that judgment uploaded.Post-judgment interestInterest on a judgment or order amount can only be claimed if allowed by the terms of the judgment or order or by the rules of the Court in which the judgment or order was given.\u00a0 An amount of interest must be specified (hereafter referred to as \u201cpost-judgment interest\u201d).The schedule of the post-judgment interest calculation must be completed if interest is claimed for any part of the period after the date of the judgment or order.\u00a0 The interest claim period should be completed, as well as the statutory provision under which the post-judgment interest is claimed, the principal on which the interest is claimed, the rate of interest and the total interest claimed.If more than one judgment or order is relied upon, a separate interest commencement date is likely to apply for each judgment or order.\u00a0 The Official Receiver may review the interest calculation and may query a calculation that could not on any reasonable or objective assessment be correct (that is, where there is an obvious or immediately apparent defect); however, the Official Receiverwill notverify the calculation of the interest claimed and correct arithmetic calculation is a matter entirely for the creditor.\u00a0 Applicants will have the assistance of an online calculation tool for this purpose.A creditor may elect not to claim post-judgment interest rather than calculate the amount.Judgment/order more than 6 years oldParagraph 41(3)(c) of the Bankruptcy Act prohibits the issue of a bankruptcy notice based on a judgment or order more than 6 years old.Costs included in judgmentA Court may order that the payment of costs be \u201ctaxed\u201d.\u00a0 A bare order for costs without specifying an amount is an order for taxed costs.\u00a0 The costs order cannot be enforced (nor a bankruptcy notice issued based upon it) until taxation by the Court or assessment by an assessor has occurred and a sealed bill of costs or a certificate is issued.In most jurisdictions, the sealed bill of costs or certificate issued following taxation or assessment of the bill is likely to constitute a \u201cfinal order\u201d without the requirement to provide a copy of the original judgment or order directing payment of costs.\u00a0 However, that will depend on the terms of legislation or other statutory instrument (usually the relevant Rules of Court) that governs taxation or assessment of costs in that jurisdiction.If an application for a bankruptcy notice is based wholly or in part on an order for taxed costs, a copy of the original judgment (or copy certified by the Court) should accompany an original of the sealed bill or certificate.\u00a0 However, where the creditor chooses not to present the original judgment or order, the creditor should provide in writing the legislative authority that directs that the bill or certificate be treated as a \u201cfinal order\u201d.\u00a0 This can be uploaded through AFSA\u2019s Online Services.If a judgment or order includes a direction for the payment of costs to be taxed, the creditor may elect not to have the costs taxed and, instead, apply for the issue of a bankruptcy notice based solely on the amount awarded in the judgment, provided the amount exceeds the $10,000 statutory minimum.Foreign judgments and debts in foreign currencyA bankruptcy notice can be issued based on a judgment or order obtained from a Court outside Australia.\u00a0 As with other judgments supporting the issue of bankruptcy notices, the creditor must be in a position to issue immediate execution.\u00a0 This will usually require registration of the foreign judgment in an Australian Court.The Official Receiver will require evidence of registration of the judgment or an explanation why registration is not required for the judgment to be enforced.Where a judgment provides for a debt in foreign currency, section 12 of the Bankruptcy Regulations provides for converting the amount to Australian currency:\u2026 using the rate of exchange for the foreign currency published by the Reserve Bank of Australia in relation to the day that is 2 business days before the day on which the application for the notice is made.Stayed and suspended judgments/ordersA Court may order that a judgment or order is stayed or suspended. \u00a0Such a judgment or order cannot support the issue of a bankruptcy notice as it is a requirement that the creditor be in a position to issue immediate execution on the judgment or order \u2013 see paragraph 41(3)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act.Example 3A judgment debtor appeals a judgment and applies for and obtains a stay of the judgment pending appeal.\u00a0 In this situation, the creditor cannot rely on the judgment for the issue of bankruptcy notice because of the stay.\u00a0 (Note that an appeal (without a stay order) does not automatically suspend the effect of a judgment for enforcement purposes \u2013 it is necessary for a Court to order a stay of execution, otherwise execution of the judgment can continue even if there is an appeal.)A judgment or order may also be stayed or suspended pending some prerequisite being satisfied \u2013 this prerequisite may or may not be contained in the judgment or order itself. A judgment subject to a precondition being satisfied to effect enforcement cannot support the issue of a bankruptcy notice unless that precondition has been satisfied.Example 4The terms of a judgment may explicitly state that it is to be suspended for a set period.Example 5Section 21B of theCrimes Act 1914provides that a certificate specifying certain details of a reparation order made in Commonwealth criminal proceedings must be filed in a civil Court before it becomes a \u201cfinal judgment.Example 6Where a judgment debt is assigned by the judgement creditor to another party (the assignee), the assignee may require leave of the Court before a writ of execution can be issued on the judgment or the judgment can otherwise be enforced \u2013 whether leave is required will depend on the Court or civil procedure rules of the Court/jurisdiction in question.\u00a0 If leave is required, the judgment or order is considered to be stayed until the Court\u2019s leave is obtained.Assigned debtsWhere a judgment creditor (the assignor) assigns a judgment debt to another creditor (the assignee), the Official Receiver will require proof of the assignment to be lodged with the application for the bankruptcy notice.Paragraph 40(3)(d) of the Bankruptcy Act provides that a person, who is for the time being entitled to enforce a final judgment or final order for the payment of money, shall be deemed to be a creditor who has obtained a final judgment or final order (and hence is entitled to seek the issue of a bankruptcy notice if the other relevant criteria are satisfied).Tribunal ordersA bankruptcy notice may be issued based on an order of a tribunal.\u00a0 Where the legislation establishing the relevant tribunal allows for the registration of orders/decisions with a Court, the onus is on the applicant creditor to do so before applying for the bankruptcy notice.Execution and issue of the bankruptcy noticeUpon issue of the bankruptcy notice, it is endorsed by the Official Receiver and a bankruptcy notice registration number and the date of issue are inserted.\u00a0 The endorsed notice will be emailed to the applicant.Time period for complianceThe debtor is to be afforded 21 days from the date of service for compliance with the bankruptcy notice.[1]\n\n",

to\u00a0serve a bankruptcy notice\u00a0on a debtor.The Official Receiver\u2019s power to extend the time for service of the notice on the debtor is discretionary.An application for an extension of time for service of a bankruptcy notice must be accompanied by a statement by the creditor or the creditor\u2019s agent explaining why an extension is required.\u00a0 The statement should outline what attempts have been made to serve the bankruptcy notice within the original 6-month period.An application for extension of time within which to serve should include details of:the number of attempts by a process server or other agent to serve the noticethe number of locations at which service has been attemptedthe attempts made to locate the debtor other than at known addressesthe likelihood that the notice will be successfully served if an extension is granted.The Official Receiver is entitled to extend the time for service of the bankruptcy notice for any period considered appropriate.\u00a0 However, periods of extension will generally only be granted in blocks of up to 6 months from the original date of expiry of the bankruptcy notice.An application to extend the time within which to serve the bankruptcy notice that is made more than 6 months after the bankruptcy notice was originally issued will only be granted in exceptional circumstances.An application for extension of time for the service of a bankruptcy notice made more than 6 months after it was originally issued must, in addition to the information outlined in paragraph5.4and the text box following that paragraph,

Official Receiver.\u00a0 However, a second (and any subsequent) extension will only be granted in exceptional circumstances.An application for a second or subsequent extension of time within which to serve a bankruptcy notice should, in addition to the information outlined in paragraph5.4and the text box following that paragraph, include:what further attempts to locate and serve the debtor have been made in the period since the previous extension was grantedthe likelihood of successfully serving the notice if another extension is granted, taking into account the failure to serve in the period since the previous extension was granted (that is, why service is more likely now than in the previous extended period).An extension is given by way of an extension notice issued by the

may wish to read the information onAFSA\u2019s website.\n\nPresenting a temporary debt protection form and eligibility considerationsCompleting and submitting the formThe debtor must present a completed temporary debt protection form.\u00a0 Debtors are encouraged to submit the form online throughAFSA\u2019s Online Services portal, with those who are unable to submit it online able to request a paper copy by contacting AFSA on 1300 364 785 or atinfo@afsa.gov.au.Only the approved form may be used.The form includes a statement of the debtor\u2019s affairs that requires details of income, assets and debts.The form also contains information, set by legislation, explaining the effect of bankruptcy, its alternatives and sources of further information.\u00a0 The debtor must read this information before submitting the form.Accuracy and completeness of information on the formThe debtor must provide correct information about their creditors. \u00a0If the application is accepted, the Official Receiver will send notification to the creditors based on the information provided by the debtor.The form must be completed to enable it to be submitted online.\u00a0 If a paper form is used, it must be completed and signed for it to be processed.The Official Receiver does not verify the information provided by the debtor on the temporary debt protection form.It is an offence for a debtor to knowingly provide false information regarding their affairs on the temporary debt protection form.\u00a0 If prosecuted and convicted of providing false information, a debtor could face imprisonment for up to 12 months.Australian connectionEach temporary debt protection form is checked to ensure that the debtor has an Australian connection.\u00a0 Having an Australian connection means that the debtor satisfies at least one of the following:is personally present or ordinarily resident in Australia, orhas a residence in Australia that they use or have used and may use as their residence, and which they may \u201crepair at their whim at any time\u201d[3], orhas a business connection with Australia (i.e. carries on business in Australia, either personally or by means of an agent or manager) or is a member of a firm or partnership that carries on business in Australia.Annexure Acontains guidelines to assist a debtor in determining whether they satisfy the Australian connection requirement.Where a debtor is unable to satisfy the Australian connection test, the Official Receiver will reject the temporary debt protection form.National Personal Insolvency Index

agreement (i.e. the agreement has not been set aside, terminated or completed)the debtor has been served with a creditor\u2019s petition that has been presented to the Court and that petition has not been withdrawn by the creditor, has not been dismissed by the Court or has not lapsedthe debtor is subject to a current controlling trustee authority that has not lapsedthe debtor signed a controlling trustee authority within the 6 months prior to the presentation of the temporary debt protection formthe Official Receiver has previously accepted a declaration of intention to present a debtor\u2019s

the debtor in writing why the form could not be accepted.\n\nAcceptance of a temporary debt protection formUpon acceptanceUpon acceptance of a temporary debt protection form, the Official Receiver will send a copy of the endorsed (signed) form to the debtor and to creditors listed on the form. \u00a0Certain debts will be frozen and unsecured creditors will not be able to take enforcement action during the stay period.\u00a0 A creditor may commence a legal proceeding or take a fresh step in such a proceeding, provided it is not in connection with enforcing a judgment.\u00a0 For the special status of secured creditors in relation to enforcing a judgment, refer to paragraphs 3.6 and 3.7 below.Stay periodThe stay period commences from the beginning of the day on which the temporary debt protection form is accepted by the Official Receiver and ends on the occurrence of any of the following events (whichever occurs first):21 days (inclusive of the day the form is accepted by the Official Receiver) after the form is acceptedthe time when a creditor\u2019s petition is presented against the debtorthe time when the debtor presents a debtor\u2019s petitionthe time when the debtor signs a controlling trustee authority (pursuant to section 188 of the Bankruptcy Act)the time when a sequestration order is made.Unsecured debtsDebts that the debtor is personally liable to pay and that are provable in bankruptcy are frozen once the Official Receiver has accepted the form.A provable debt is one that entitles the creditor to participate in dividends paid in the bankrupt estate. \u00a0Section 82 of the Bankruptcy Act outlines which debts are provable and sections 83 to 107 provide further detailed information about provable debts.Debts that are not frozen include debts arising from a maintenance agreement or order, fines and penalties imposed by Courts or HELP debts.\u00a0 These debts are not provable in bankruptcy and hence are not frozen, nor is enforcement action stayed, when a temporary debt protection form is accepted.More information about which categories of debts are provable is available inTreatment of debts in bankruptcy.Secured debtsThe rights of secured creditors are not affected by the acceptance of a temporary debt protection form and there is nothing preventing a secured creditor from continuing to realise or otherwise deal with its security.Duties of sheriff and Court registrar upon notificationA sheriff must refrain from executing any enforcement process in respect of the debtor\u2019s property, unless the sheriff is acting on behalf of a secured creditor and enforcement is on the secured property.\u00a0 Where the sheriff has already executed on the enforcement process but has not paid the proceeds to the creditor/Court, the sheriff and/or Court registrar is prevented from disbursing those proceeds until the expiry of the stay period.\u00a0 Should the debtor become bankrupt during or at the end of the stay period, the proceeds from any execution are to be remitted to the bankruptcy trustee.Garnishee ordersIf a person is required to deduct or retain money owing to the debtor in accordance with a garnishee order, upon receiving notification of the acceptance of a temporary debt protection form that person must not deduct or otherwise apply the money that is due to the debtor.\u00a0 This situation typically applies to an employer who has received a garnishee order(s) from a creditor(s) of the debtor.Where the Australian Taxation Office has a statutory garnishee in place, it is able to continue to recover the debt during the stay period.Notifying creditors and/or employers and/or sheriffsWhere the Official Receiver is satisfied that the debtor meets the eligibility requirements and the temporary debt protection form is current and complete, the Official Receiver sends out a notification of the acceptance of the form to the debtor, their authorised representative and all creditors who have been listed on the form.\u00a0 A copy of the form, as endorsed by the Official Receiver, is attached to the notification.Where a debtor has nominated another person(s), such as their employer or the sheriff, to receive the notification so that pay deductions or other enforcement action is stopped, a copy of the notification is also sent to this person(s).The notification contains a unique reference number that creditors may quote to AFSA to verify the acceptance of the debtor\u2019s temporary debt protection form.Where information was omitted from the formIf the debtor subsequently advises the Official Receiver in writing of an additional creditor that was not included on their form, a notice will be provided to that creditor.\u00a0 An additional notice may not be sent where the stay is expected to end within one week.Where the debtor has inadvertently omitted any other material particular in relation to their income or property, the debtor may advise the Official Receiver in writing of such an omission and a revised notification may be sent to all creditors.\u00a0 A revised notification may not be sent where, in the opinion of the Official Receiver, the omission is not material and is unlikely to affect the creditors in general, or if the stay is expected to end within 3 business days.NoNPIIrecord createdAcceptance of a temporary debt protection form is not recorded on the National Personal Insolvency Index.\u00a0 However, an administrative record of the lodgement and acceptance of the form is created.\n\n",
            "Upon acceptance\n\nUpon acceptance of a temporary debt protection form, the Official Receiver will send a copy of the endorsed (signed) form to the debtor and to creditors listed on the form. \u00a0Certain debts will be frozen and unsecured creditors will not be able to take enforcement action during the stay period.\u00a0 A creditor may commence a legal proceeding or take a fresh step in such a proceeding, provided it is not in connection with enforcing a judgment.\u00a0 For the special status of secured creditors in relation to enforcing a judgment, refer to paragraphs 3.6 and 3.7 below.\n\nStay period\n\nThe stay period commences from the beginning of the day on which the temporary debt protection form is accepted by the Official Receiver and ends on the occurrence of any of the following events (whichever occurs first):21 days (inclusive of the day the form is accepted by the Official Receiver) after the form is acceptedthe time when a creditor\u2019s petition is presented against the debtorthe time when the debtor presents a debtor\u2019s petitionthe time when the debtor signs a controlling trustee authority (pursuant to section 188 of the Bankruptcy Act)the time when a sequestration order is made.\n\n21 days (inclusive of the day the form is accepted by the Official Receiver) after the form is accepted\n\nthe time when a creditor\u2019s petition is presented against the debtor\n\nthe time when the debtor presents a debtor\u2019s petition\n\nthe time when the debtor signs a controlling trustee authority (pursuant to section 188 of the Bankruptcy Act)\n\nthe time when a sequestration order is made.\n\nUnsecured debts\n\nDebts that the debtor is personally liable to pay and that are provable in bankruptcy are frozen once the Official Receiver has accepted the form.\n\nA provable debt is one that entitles the creditor to participate in dividends paid in the bankrupt estate. \u00a0Section 82 of the Bankruptcy Act outlines which debts are provable and sections 83 to 107 provide further detailed information about provable debts.\n\nDebts that are not frozen include debts arising from a maintenance agreement or order, fines and penalties imposed by Courts or HELP debts.\u00a0 These debts are not provable in bankruptcy and hence are not frozen, nor is enforcement action stayed, when a temporary debt protection form is accepted.\n\nMore information about which categories of debts are provable is available inTreatment of debts in bankruptcy.\n\nSecured debts\n\nThe rights of secured creditors are not affected by the acceptance of a temporary debt protection form and there is nothing preventing a secured creditor from continuing to realise or otherwise deal with its security.\n\nDuties of sheriff and Court registrar upon notification\n\nA sheriff must refrain from executing any enforcement process in respect of the debtor\u2019s property, unless the sheriff is acting on behalf of a secured creditor and enforcement is on the secured property.\u00a0 Where the sheriff has already executed on the enforcement process but has not paid the proceeds to the creditor/Court, the sheriff and/or Court registrar is prevented from disbursing those proceeds until the expiry of the stay period.\u00a0 Should the debtor become bankrupt during or at the end of the stay period, the proceeds from any execution are to be remitted to the bankruptcy trustee.\n\nGarnishee orders\n\nIf a person is required to deduct or retain money owing to the debtor in accordance with a garnishee order, upon receiving notification of the acceptance of a temporary debt protection form that person must not deduct or otherwise apply the money that is due to the debtor.\u00a0 This situation typically applies to an employer who has received a garnishee order(s) from a creditor(s) of the debtor.\n\nWhere the Australian Taxation Office has a statutory garnishee in place, it is able to continue to recover the debt during the stay period.\n\nNotifying creditors and/or employers and/or sheriffs\n\nWhere the Official Receiver is satisfied that the debtor meets the eligibility requirements and the temporary debt protection form is current and complete, the Official Receiver sends out a notification of the acceptance of the form to the debtor, their authorised representative and all creditors who have been listed on the form.\u00a0 A copy of the form, as endorsed by the Official Receiver, is attached to the notification.\n\n",

Bankruptcy FormSubsection 55(2) of the Bankruptcy Act requires a debtor to use the \u201capproved form\u201d when lodging a debtor\u2019s petition.\u00a0The online and paper Bankruptcy Forms are both approved for this purpose.The debtor can complete and lodge the Digital Bankruptcy Form available viaAFSA\u2019s Online Services portal.\u00a0 If the debtor experiencing difficulty in completing the form online or is\u00a0unable to lodge the form via the portal, a paper copy can be obtained by contacting AFSA on 1300 364 785 or atinfo@afsa.gov.au.Subsection 55(3) of the Bankruptcy Act allows the Official Receiver discretion to reject a petition if it does not comply substantially with the approved form.\u00a0 This means that the Official Receiver may reject a petition if the debtor does not use the current version of the Bankruptcy Form.Debtors wishing to lodge their petitions jointly with someone else or as a partnership will need to create their own separate accounts and complete separate petitions and lodge these on the same day.\u00a0 Each debtor will need to state that they are applying jointly or as part of a partnership and provide the names of the related parties.The Official Receiver will not be able to process a joint petition unless all joint parties lodge their petitions together. \u00a0Offline joint petitions will need to be posted or emailed together in order to ensure they are processed together.Adequate completion of the Bankruptcy FormSubsection 55(3) of the Bankruptcy Act allows the Official Receiver discretion to reject a petition if the Official Receiver thinks it has not been adequately completed.\u00a0 A Bankruptcy Form is not considered to be adequately completed unless:the debtor has adequately answered all questions relevant to the debtorthere is sufficient information to identify the debtorin the case of an offline form, it is legible, signed and datedit accurately reflects the debtor\u2019s current affairs.Whether a Bankruptcy Form is adequately completed will depend on the information provided based on the debtor\u2019s circumstances as set out on the form.A Bankruptcy Form may be rejected if it is incomplete or illegible and cannot be reliably used to enter the debtor\u2019s information on theNational Personal Insolvency Index(\u201cNPII\u201d).Prescribed informationAs part of the debtor\u2019s petition process, the Official Receiver must give a debtor information regarding the alternatives to and consequences of bankruptcy.\u00a0 This is called prescribed information and is a requirement of the Bankruptcy Regulations.The debtor must acknowledge having read the prescribed information on the Bankruptcy Form before lodging their petition.\u00a0 A debtor will not be able to lodge a digital Bankruptcy Form unless they have made this acknowledgement.\u00a0 The Official Receiver cannot accept an offline Bankruptcy Form where the debtor omits this acknowledgement.Proof of debtor identityThe debtor must satisfy proof of identity checks as part of the Bankruptcy Form submission process.\u00a0 This can be done online via Document Verification Service or, for an offline submission, by the debtor having their identification verified by an authorised witness.If the debtor does not have sufficient identification to complete the proof of identity checks, they should contact AFSA on 1300 364 785.Where a debtor who is incarcerated wishes to lodge a Bankruptcy Form, they will need to lodge a Bankruptcy Form offline (a paper form).\u00a0 The debtor\u2019s prisoner identification card will satisfy the proof of identity requirements where it is verified by an authorised witness.\n\n",

Receiver may consider exercising discretionary powers to reject a petition are contained inannexure D.\n\nAcceptance of a debtor\u2019s petitionThe Official Receiver will check the Bankruptcy Form as outlined above.\u00a0 If no reason to reject the petition is identified, it will be accepted. \u00a0A debtor becomes bankrupt when the Official Receiver accepts their petition.\u00a0 Mere lodgment of a petition by a debtor is not sufficient to make the debtor bankrupt.The Official Receiver must refer a petition to the Federal Court or Federal Circuit and Family Court for direction on whether to accept or reject it if the debtor has lodged a petition in their own name only and is subject to a pending creditor\u2019s petition along with another person(s) (subsection 55(3B)).Joint administrationsThe Official Receiver will create a joint administration (i.e. a bankruptcy involving more than one bankrupt debtor) where two or more debtors have presented debtors\u2019 petitions and they have indicated in their petitions that they are joint debtors and:and a review of their statements of affairs indicates that there are joint assets that must be dealt with, and/ora registered trustee has consented to administer the estates of joint debtors and has asked that a joint administration be created.Appointment of a trusteeA trustee will be appointed to administer a bankrupt estate upon acceptance of the debtor\u2019s Bankruptcy Form.A debtor has the option of choosing a specific registered trustee to administer their estate.\u00a0 A correctly executedForm 12 \u2013 Trustee consent to act declarationmust accompany the Bankruptcy Form in order for the debtor\u2019s chosen trustee to be appointed.If a completed consent to act form is not received with the debtor\u2019s petition, the Official Receiver may source a consent to act from a registered trustee or may appoint the Official Trustee.A registered trustee may consent to administer an estate on their own or may consent to act with another trustee.\u00a0 The Official Trustee does not consent to administer estates jointly with a registered trustee.Contact details for registered trustees in each State and Territory can be found onAFSA\u2019s website.A copy of the debtor\u2019s Bankruptcy Form is provided to the appointed trustee.\u00a0 Any attachments are also provided.Following the initial appointment of a trustee at the date of bankruptcy, creditors may later request that the trustee be replaced or the trustee may arrange for the estate to be transferred to another trustee.\u00a0 Once the debtor\u2019s petition is accepted and the debtor has become bankrupt, they do not have the ability to change the trustee or to prevent the appointment of another trustee.The National Personal Insolvency Index and requesting suppression of informationThe acceptance of the debtor\u2019s petition is recorded electronically and a bankruptcy number is assigned to the debtor\u2019s bankrupt estate.\u00a0 The debtor\u2019s name, any alias(es), date of birth, date of bankruptcy, address and occupation are entered on the NPII.\u00a0 The trustee\u2019s details are also entered.Bankruptcy records entered on the NPII are permanent.A debtor may apply to have their address and/or occupation suppressed or not entered on the NPII if the debtor believes that publishing

            "Stage oneDebtor appoints a controlling trustee and gives a proposalThe PIA process commences when the debtor appoints a controlling trustee by signing acontrolling trustee authority formand provides the controlling trustee with astatement of affairsand a draft PIA that details the proposal for settling their debts.\u00a0 By appointing a controlling trustee, the debtor effectively hands control over their property to the trustee.The control over the debtor\u2019s property becomes effective once the controlling trustee accepts the appointment by signing the controlling trustee authority form.It is recommended that a debtor talk to a controlling trustee before completing any of the documents.\u00a0 A controlling trustee can provide guidance about completing the forms and drafting a PIA and can inform the debtor of their rights and obligations.Forms and documents that must be filed with the Official Receiver at stage oneSubsection 188(5) of the Bankruptcy Act and subsection 61(2) of theBankruptcy Regulations 2021prescribe that, within 2 business days after signing the consent, the controlling trustee must file with the Official Receiver:a)the completed controlling trustee authority form (which includes the trustee\u2019s consent to exercise the powers given by the authority)b)the debtor\u2019s completed statement of affairs form.\u00a0 TheForm 3is the approved form for use.A fee is payable to the Official Receiver upon lodgment of the above forms/ documents.\u00a0 See thefees and chargespage of AFSA\u2019s website for the current fee.Official Receiver\u2019s role in registering a PIA proposalThe Official Receiver may refuse to register the controlling trustee authority if:the required forms are incomplete and/or an incorrect form(s) has been usedthe debtor is ineligible to propose a PIAthe person appointed as controlling trustee is ineligible, and/orthe registration fee has not been paid.Checking eligibility of the debtor \u2013 previous proposalsA debtor cannot give a controlling trustee authority within 6 months of giving an effective controlling trustee authority (pursuant to subsection 188(4) of the Bankruptcy Act).\u00a0 The 6-month period begins from the date the debtor signed the authority (the \u201cdate of authority\u201d).If the debtor is ineligible to present the authority, the Official Receiver will advise them by letter.\u00a0 The controlling trustee that consented to act under the authority will also be advised.\u00a0 In this situation, the authority is ineffective and no record is entered on the NPII.\u00a0 An administrative record of the presentation of the documents and the reason for the debtor\u2019s inability to present an authority is created, and an electronic image of the documents is retained by the Official Receiver as part of the administrative record.Checking eligibility of the debtor \u2013 Australian connectionA debtor may only give a controlling trustee authority if they have an Australian connection.\u00a0 To satisfy the Australian connection test, a debtor must:be personally present or ordinarily resident in Australiahave a residence in Australia that they use or have used and may use as a residence, and to which they may \u201crepair at their whim at any time\u201d,[1]orhave a business connection with Australia (i.e. the debtor carries on business in Australia, either personally or by means of an agent or manager) or be a member of a firm or partnership that carries on business in Australia.Annexure Acontains guidelines regarding determining whether a person can be considered ordinarily resident in Australia, to have a \u201cdwelling-house\u201d in Australia or to be operating a business in Australia.Where a debtor is unable to satisfy the Australian connection test, the debtor is ineligible to sign a controlling trustee authority.\u00a0 In this situation, the authority is ineffective and no record is entered on the NPII.\u00a0 As with the debtor being ineligible because they lodged a previous proposal, an administrative record of the presentation of the documents and the reason for the debtor\u2019s inability to present an authority is created, and an electronic image of the documents is retained by the Official Receiver as part of the administrative record.Checking eligibility of the controlling trusteeThe controlling trustee can be a registered trustee, an eligible solicitor or the Official Trustee.REGISTERED TRUSTEE: anyregistered trusteecan be appointed as a controlling trustee.SOLICITOR: pursuant to section 49 of the Bankruptcy Regulations, a solicitor is required to be a full member of the Australian Restructuring Insolvency and Turnaround Association or to have satisfactorily completed a course in insolvency approved by the Inspector-General in order to be eligible to be a controlling trustee.\u00a0 If the proposed solicitor controlling trustee is unknown to the Official Receiver, a statement of eligibility and evidence is required before the proposal can be registered.OFFICIAL TRUSTEE: while the Bankruptcy Act permits the Official Trustee to act as a controlling trustee, the Official Receiver does not normally consent to do this.\u00a0 Instead, debtors are encouraged to seek the consent of a registered trustee or eligible solicitor.If the controlling trustee is ineligible, the authority is ineffective and no record is entered on the NPII.\u00a0 The debtor and ineligible party will be advised in writing.\u00a0 An administrative record of the presentation of the documents is created and the electronic image of the documents is retained by the Official Receiver as part of the administrative record.Pending creditor\u2019s petitionWhere there is a creditor\u2019s petition on foot in the Federal Court or the Federal Circuit and Family Court (\u201cthe Court\u201d) and a controlling trustee authority given by the debtor becomes effective, all proceedings in respect of the creditor\u2019s petition are stayed (pursuant to section 189AAA of the Bankruptcy Act) until a meeting of creditors called under the authority is concluded or adjourned, whichever is sooner.The Official Receiver will notify the Court and the petitioning creditor of the lodgment of an effective controlling trustee authority.Note that the 12-month life of a creditor\u2019s petition (see subsection 52(4)) is not affected by section 189AAA of the Bankruptcy Act.\u00a0 Therefore, if the 12-month period expires while the stay under section 189AAA is in operation, the creditor\u2019s petition still lapses.\u00a0 Further, section 189AAA precludes the petitioning creditor from applying to the Court for an extension of the life of the creditor\u2019s petition while the stay is in place.Filling of vacancy in officeThe Official Trustee is automatically appointed as controlling trustee in certain limited circumstances (for example, if the previous trustee dies or otherwise becomes ineligible, as per subsection 192(1) of the Bankruptcy Act).\n\n",

into the debtor\u2019s affairs and then compiles a comprehensive report to creditors.The report includes a comparison of the return that creditors can expect from the proposed PIA and the return they could expect to receive if the debtor became bankrupt and whether the trustee believes that creditors\u2019 interests would be better served by accepting the debtor\u2019s proposed PIA or by the bankruptcy of the debtor.\u00a0 The Courts have held that the report should specify an approximate rate of return to creditors, for example 60 cents in the dollar.\u00a0 The controlling trustee normally makes a recommendation to creditors in the report concerning the merits or otherwise of the proposed PIA.Controlling trustee convenes a creditors\u2019 meetingA creditors\u2019 meeting must

it must be passed by a special resolution \u2013 that is, a majority in number and at least 75 per cent in debt value of the voting creditors must vote in favour (pursuant to subsection 204(1) of the Bankruptcy Act).If the creditors vote by special resolution to accept the proposal, they must appoint a trustee to administer the terms of the agreement.\u00a0 This trustee is usually the same person who was appointed as the controlling trustee by the debtor (where the controlling trustee was a registered trustee) but creditors may appoint another trustee.\u00a0 Only a registered trustee or the Official Trustee can be the trustee of a PIA.\u00a0 (Note, however, that the Official Trustee does not ordinarily consent to administer a personal insolvency agreement.)If the creditors decide not to accept the PIA proposal they can, by special resolution, decide to either hand back control of the debtor\u2019s property to the debtor or require them to present a debtor\u2019s petition within 7 days from the date the special resolution is passed (see subsection 204(1) of the Bankruptcy Act).\u00a0 It is important to note that, unless the creditors resolve to hand back control of the property to the debtor, the property of the debtor remains under the control of the controlling trustee until:the expiry of 4 months from the date the controlling trustee authority became effectiveuntil the debtor becomes bankruptuntil the debtor dies, oruntil the Court releases the property from control,whichever event happens sooner.Forms and documents that must be filed with the Official Receiver at stage twoThe controlling trustee is required to give to the Official Receiver the following:e)a copy of the controlling trustee\u2019s report and declaration of relationships required under section 189Af)a copy of the controlling trustee\u2019s statement under section 189B in relation to special resolutions expected to be passed at the meeting.Following the creditors\u2019 meetingIf a special resolution is passed at the meeting of creditors, the controlling trustee must give to the Official Receiver within 7 days after the date on which the resolution was passed:g)notice of special resolution(s) passed at a meeting of creditors (with copies of the resolution(s)) (see section 62 of the Bankruptcy Regulations)h)consent of the PIA trustee (only applicable if creditors resolve to accept the proposal) (see section 215A of the Bankruptcy Act).If a special resolution is passed requiring the debtor to execute a PIA, the resolution must specify the provisions to be included in the agreement (see subsection 204(2) of the Bankruptcy Act).\u00a0 Creditors must also resolve to nominate a trustee or trustees to be trustee(s) of the agreement (see subsection 204(3)).If the creditors\u2019 meeting is adjourned, the controlling trustee should notify the Official Receiver of the date of the subsequent meeting.\u00a0 It is also recommended practice that the controlling trustee inform the Official Receiver if there was no outcome from the meeting.Upon ending of the control periodWithin 7 days of a trustee becoming aware of an event that causes the control period to end, the trustee must file with the Official Receiver:i)written notification that the control has ended (subsection 189(1B) of the Bankruptcy Act).\n\n",
            "Controlling trustee makes enquiries and prepares a report\n\nThe controlling trustee makes extensive enquiries into the debtor\u2019s affairs and then compiles a comprehensive report to creditors.\n\nThe report includes a comparison of the return that creditors can expect from the proposed PIA and the return they could expect to receive if the debtor became bankrupt and whether the trustee believes that creditors\u2019 interests would be better served by accepting the debtor\u2019s proposed PIA or by the bankruptcy of the debtor.\u00a0 The Courts have held that the report should specify an approximate rate of return to creditors, for example 60 cents in the dollar.\u00a0 The controlling trustee normally makes a recommendation to creditors in the report concerning the merits or otherwise of the proposed PIA.\n\nControlling trustee convenes a creditors\u2019 meeting\n\nA creditors\u2019 meeting must be held not more than 30 business days from the date the controlling trustee accepted the appointment (pursuant to Insolvency Practice Rule 75-27).\u00a0 Not less than 10 business days\u2019 notice of the meeting must be given (Insolvency Practice Rule 75-20).\u00a0 The approvedForm 38 \u2013 Notice of meeting of creditorsmust be used to notify creditors of the meeting.\n\nThe controlling trustee must send creditors a copy of each of the following documents (Insolvency Practice Rule 75-27):the debtor\u2019s statement of affairsthe controlling trustee\u2019s report and declaration of relationships required by section 189A of the Bankruptcy Actthe controlling trustee\u2019s statement required by section 189B of the Bankruptcy Act about special resolutions reasonably expected to be passed at the meeting.\n\nthe debtor\u2019s statement of affairs\n\nthe controlling trustee\u2019s report and declaration of relationships required by section 189A of the Bankruptcy Act\n\nthe controlling trustee\u2019s statement required by section 189B of the Bankruptcy Act about special resolutions reasonably expected to be passed at the meeting.\n\nThe controlling trustee to give to the Official Receiver at the time of calling the meeting of creditors:c)a copy of the draft PIA proposal (subsection 61(3) of the Bankruptcy Regulations)d)the PIA proposal checklist, which is designed as an aid to the debtor and the controlling trustee in ensuring that the proposed PIA contains all the elements that are prescribed by legislation, must be filed.\n\nc)a copy of the draft PIA proposal (subsection 61(3) of the Bankruptcy Regulations)\n\nd)the PIA proposal checklist, which is designed as an aid to the debtor and the controlling trustee in ensuring that the proposed PIA contains all the elements that are prescribed by legislation, must be filed.\n\nAdvertising the first meeting on the AFSA website\n\nSubsection 75-40(4) of the Rules requires that first meeting of creditors that is convened under Part X of the Bankruptcy Act be advertised on the AFSA website.\n\nNotice of a meeting of creditors needs to be lodged with AFSA at least 10 business days before the scheduled meeting date.\u00a0 This must be done via the form in AFSA\u2019sonline services portal.\n\nPublishing details of a creditors\u2019 meetings is a cost recovered fee service, consistent with the Australian Government Cost Recovery Guidelines, which require agencies to set charges to recover the costs of products or services where it is efficient to do so.\u00a0 The fee for advertising a meeting is $260 (GST inclusive), as per section 2A.01 of theBankruptcy (Fees and Remuneration) Determination 2015.\n\nFrom 1 October 2020, the fee for advertising creditor meetings can only be paid on account.\u00a0 A monthly invoice will be issued to each practitioner for all publishing requests received in the month.\n\nThe meeting details will be published on theCreditor meetingspage of the AFSA website.\n\nThe meeting details will be removed 5 business days after the meeting date.\n\nThe controlling trustee holds the creditors\u2019 meeting\n\nAt the meeting, creditors vote whether to accept the debtor\u2019s PIA proposal.\u00a0 For the proposal to be accepted, it must be passed by a special resolution \u2013 that is, a majority in number and at least 75 per cent in debt value of the voting creditors must vote in favour (pursuant to subsection 204(1) of the Bankruptcy Act).\n\n",

regarding problems, terminations and variations.\n\nProblems, variations, and terminationsFailure of trustee to execute PIAIf the PIA is not executed by the nominated registered trustee, a meeting of creditors can be called by any creditor or the debtor to nominate a replacement registered trustee.\u00a0 The meeting must be called for that purpose and a resolution passed (section 217).Filling of vacancy in officeWhere a vacancy occurs in the office of the trustee of a PIA, the Official Trustee becomes trustee (subsection 231(5) and section 160 of the Bankruptcy Act and Part 3 of Schedule 3 of the Bankruptcy Regulations).\u00a0 In such instances, the Official Trustee will normally transfer the matter to another registered trustee under section 181A of the Bankruptcy Act.Debtor fails to attend meeting, execute PIA etc.The Inspector-General, a creditor or the controlling trustee may apply to the Court to make a sequestration order against the debtor (see section 221 of the Bankruptcy Act) in the following instances:the debtor has failed, without sufficient cause, to attend meeting of creditorsthe debtor contravenes subsection 189(2) (that is, removes, disposes of or deals with property without the trustee\u2019s consent, does not give trustee information that trustee requires or does not comply with a trustee direction)the debtor has failed, without sufficient cause, to execute the PIA within the specified timethe meeting has not passed one of the special resolutions under subsection 204(1) within 4 months from date the meeting was called.If the Court makes a sequestration order, the applicant must file the order with the Official Receiver within 2 business days of the order being made (pursuant to section 66 of the Bankruptcy Regulations).Variation of PIA by resolution of creditorsThe terms of a PIA can be varied during the life of the PIA by a special resolution at a meeting of creditors called for that purpose.\u00a0 Variation of a PIA is provided for by section 221A of the Bankruptcy Act.\u00a0 Normally, the debtor contacts the trustee seeking a variation of the terms and, if the trustee considers the variation to be reasonable, the trustee seeks the approval of creditors.As an alternative to a formal meeting of creditors to consider the variation, the trustee can notify the creditors that the proposed variation to the PIA will take effect on a specified date and inform them that, if they wish to object to the variation, they are required to do so in writing at least 2 days before the specified date.\u00a0 If there are no objections by creditors, the variation takes effect on the specified date.\u00a0 If a creditor objects, the trustee may hold a meeting for creditors to consider the proposed variation.Setting aside of PIA by the CourtThere are various situations under which the Court may set aside a PIA on the application of the Inspector-General, the trustee, a creditor or the debtor.\u00a0 These situations include:the terms of the agreement are unreasonable or are not calculated to benefit the creditors generallythe agreement does not comply with the requirements of the legislationthe agreement is based on false or misleading information.The application for an order to set aside a PIA can only be made before all the obligations that the PIA created have been discharged.The application to set aside the PIA may also include an application for a sequestration order.Termination by the trusteeThe trustee may terminate a PIA by written notice to the creditors if the trustee is satisfied that the debtor is in default (see section 222A of the Bankruptcy Act).\u00a0 The notice must include a statement of the reasons for the termination and its impact on creditors and specify a date on which the termination is to take effect (not less than 14 days after the notice is given).The PIA is terminated if the debtor is in default and creditors have not lodged a written notice of objection to the termination at least 2 days before the proposed termination takes effect.Termination by creditorsThe creditors may terminate a PIA by resolution at a meeting called for that purpose if the debtor is in default and the trustee tabled, before the resolution, a written declaration that the trustee is satisfied the debtor is in default (see section 222B of the Bankruptcy Act).Termination by the CourtThe trustee, a creditor, the debtor or, if the debtor has died, the person administering the estate of the debtor may apply to the Court to terminate a PIA (see section 222C of the Bankruptcy Act).\u00a0 The Court may make an order terminating the PIA if it is satisfied that:the debtor or, where the debtor had died, the person administering the estate has failed to carry out or comply with a term of the PIAthe PIA cannot be proceeded with without injustice or undue delayfor any other reason the PIA ought to be terminated.The application to terminate the PIA may include an application for a sequestration order against the debtor.Should a sequestration order be made, it is required to be filed with the Official Receiver.The making of an application for a sequestration order is taken to be equivalent to the presentation of a creditor\u2019s petition (but the requirements relating to creditors\u2019 petitions in subsections 43(1), 52(1) and 52(2) and sections 44 and 47 of the Bankruptcy Act do not apply).Termination by occurrence of a terminating eventA PIA is \u201cautomatically\u201d terminated if it includes a provision for termination on the happening of a specified event (for example, loss of employment for a period exceeding 3 months, death of the debtor etc.) and the event occurs.Forms and documents that must be filed with the Official ReceiverUpon variation, termination or setting aside of a PIA, the trustee must lodge:n)aForm 19 \u2013 Notice of completion, variation, termination or setting aside of a PIA (Part X), composition or scheme of arrangement (Part IV)notifying the Official Receiver of the variation/termination/ setting aside of the PIA.Where a PIA is terminated or set aside by the Court, the Official Receiver must be given a copy of the Court order by the person who applied to the Court within 2 business days of the making of the order (see section 66 of the Bankruptcy Regulations). \u00a0The notification requirement does not apply

The delegate may contact your referees or ask for additional referees to be provided.Should you demonstrate sufficient knowledge and abilities at interview, and meet the fit and proper test, an on-site inspection by AFSA of your business will occur to ascertain whether your business systems, controls and practices are sufficient. \u00a0The delegate\u2019s decision on whether to approve the application will be based on all aspects.More information about the areas of expected technical knowledge for a person applying to be a registered debt agreement administrator is available inannexure A.InsurancePrior to approving registration the delegate will also need to be satisfied that the applicant will take out:adequate and appropriate professional indemnity insuranceadequate and appropriate fidelity insuranceagainst the liabilities that the applicant may incur working as a debt agreement administrator.The level of professional indemnity insurance to be taken out is expected to comply with the professional standards scheme of the national occupational association to which the administrator belongs. \u00a0If the administrator does not belong to a national occupational association then a level of insurance equivalent with either of the schemes of Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (\u201cCAANZ\u201d) or CPA Australia is considered adequate. \u00a0There is no particular expectation about the level of fidelity insurance except that it be adequate and appropriate for the administrator\u2019s circumstances and should at least cover the value of assets held. \u00a0Sole operators with no employees will not generally be required to hold fidelity insurance.InterviewAs part of the assessment of your application, you will initially be interviewed by delegates of the Inspector-General from Enforcement and Practitioner Surveillance at one of AFSA\u2019s offices. \u00a0You will be questioned to assess your knowledge across a range of both technical and general business commerce areas. \u00a0The interview will be an \u201copen text\u201d or \u201copen book\u201d style and will include an oral exam to determine your level of knowledge. \u00a0The delegates will also question you on the systems and practices you, or the company, will have in place. \u00a0You will be provided the questions 30 minutes before your allotted interview time to enable you to prepare responses. \u00a0The interview should take around one hour.The area where knowledge is required to be demonstrated, and the type of knowledge, is listed in detail below in the assessment of capabilities section.To ensure an accurate record is maintained of the responses, the interview will be recorded.In some instances the delegates may be uncertain from the oral exam about your level of knowledge in a particular area. \u00a0In this case, rather than refuse the application at that time, the delegates may wish to check that area of knowledge by asking you to return at a later time to sit a short written exam on that particular area.In the case of a corporate applicant, each person applying to become the individual with overall management responsibility of the company\u2019s debt agreement activities will need to go through this process. \u00a0It is desirable that the application by the person with overall management responsibility is made before or at the same time as the company application.Should the delegate decide that you have not demonstrated sufficient knowledge or ability at the interview and any subsequent written exam held, the application will be refused. \u00a0The application will also be refused where the relevant people are not \u00a0found to be fit and proper. \u00a0Should this occur, reasons for the refusal and your right of appeal will be provided to you.Referee reportsTwo referee reports are required. \u00a0Each report provided should contain the following details:the referee\u2019s name, address, email address and telephone numberthe referee\u2019s occupationthe period during which, and the circumstances under which, the referee has known the applicantthe referee\u2019s opinion about the following matters:the applicant\u2019s abilities in oral and written communicationif known to the referee, the applicant\u2019s knowledge of the powers, duties and functions of a debt agreement administratorthe applicant\u2019s knowledge of business matters and ability to successfully conduct business activitiesthe referee\u2019s opinion as to the applicant\u2019s honesty, integrity, diligence, judgment and good characterwhether, in the referee\u2019s opinion, the applicant has the skills and ability to carry out the duties of a debt agreement administrator within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act, and if so, the referee\u2019s reasons for supporting the application.Inspection of systems and controlsOnce the applicant has successfully completed the oral exam and any subsequent written exam, the applicant will also need to demonstrate that they have adequate systems and controls in the business to perform the work.This will be assessed by officers of Enforcement and Practitioner Surveillance who will arrange a time to visit your place of business. \u00a0They will examine your business systems, controls and practices including accounting and banking arrangements and report their findings to the delegate. \u00a0The level of the systems and controls you need will depend for example on your business size, structure and location.If you intend to use agents, employees or brokers to provide some of the services to debtors, this may also include an inspection of the practices involving these parties, including the extent of training, quality assurance, documentation, your relationship with brokers and your ability to monitor and supervise the services being provided on your behalf.Enforcement and Practitioner Surveillance will provide immediate feedback of any deficiencies identified when undertaking its inspection of the systems and controls and may defer making a decision whilst still keeping within the 45-day timeframe if these are capable of being remedied within that time.Assessment of capabilities and characterThe delegate\u2019s decision will focus on determining whether an administrator has the abilities and knowledge to properly perform the duties required and is a fit and proper person to act as an administrator. \u00a0The duties of an administrator and how the delegate will assess the capabilities to perform those duties are outlined in the Guidelines.In considering your application for registration, the delegate may refer to information held or made available by a relevant professional body such as the Personal Insolvency Professionals Association (\u201cPIPA\u201d). \u00a0Applicants who are current members of PIPA are advised that the material they provide in their application may be shared with PIPA to seek their views on the applicant. \u00a0The response provided may form part of the information the delegate will use to inform their decision.In considering your application for registration, the delegate may also refer to publicly available information held or made available by other regulators and external dispute resolution schemes, such as ASIC, Australian Financial Complaints Authority (\u201cAFCA\u201d) etc. \u00a0This information, such as enforceable undertakings or complaint findings, may form part of the information the delegate will use to inform their decision.\n\n",
